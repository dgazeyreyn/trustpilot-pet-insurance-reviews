I talked to Brian, who answered all of my questions and concerns after a bad experience with Spot Pet Insurance. We adopted a 4 month old Silver Miniature Poodle 9 months ago. We purchased pet insurance to cover needed vet bills and medicines for our baby. We recently took Sterling to the vet for a heartworm test so we could get our new prescription for Trifexis, which I was expecting to be reimbursed for the test and the 6 month prescription. The vet informed me that there is a new year long shot for heartworms and told us how much it cost and that the shot only prevents heartworms and we would still need flea and tick prevention. We decided to do the heartworm shot and purchased Bravecto for fleas and ticks for 3 months for each application. When I sent my claim in to Spot, they approved $25 for all treatment (Test was $41, Heartworm Shot was $107 and 3 month prevention for Fleas and Ticks (Bravecto) was $75.70, $223.70 Total). They said they only cover $25 per year for heartworm tests, prevention and flea and tick prevention. $25 for the year!! I questioned this and they told me it was on page 10 of the contract. I searched with them on the phone to find it on the last page of the contract (Page 21) after the name and address of the company that carries the policy, not Page 10. It is hidden at the end on the very last page! I immediately canceled my policy with them and ended on the phone with Brian with Embrace! Brian was very professional and knowledgeable about the insurance policy and what I needed for the coverage I was interested in. I told him I wanted to talk to my husband before I actually made a decision about coverage. He told me he could call me back at noon the next day, which was a Saturday.

So  I called and spoke with a rep and had her tell me word for word what I needed to email my vet and request them to send. The vet sent everything they asked. But Because our dog has never had anything other than vaccines and wellness visits, there are no extensive notes. So Embrace says their notes are insufficient.

The vet performed an x-ray and determined my cat had bronchitis and prescribed medication to treat it. They additionally performed blood work as it had been a while since checking her levels. In total, I had two separate vet bills totaling over $400. 

I submit two claims to Embrace, one for each invoice, and they were both denied on the reason my cat had a ""pre-existing condition"". The ""condition"" was the fact that she vomited 8 months prior to her vet visit (as cats tend to vomit), completely unrelated to the development of bronchitis. This vomit incident was included in the onboarding information Embrace received from my vet. I submit an appeal to the denial and they said after reaching out to my vet, they were declining my appeal. I spoke with my vet, who reported Embrace never reached out to them. They also provided a letter stating the one vomit incident months prior to the appointment had no bearing on the bronchitis diagnosis. My second claim was ALSO denied for the SAME reason. When I appealed it, they simply deleted the claim.

Then search on words to claim pre existing condition.  Pet insurance is sketchy to begin with. You will always pay more the. They payout.  Appeals are just as ridiculous. So when faced with 2k charges for possible cancer diagnosis.  They will use weight loss a pre existing condtio 
To deny everything.   Every previous cold, scratch, anorexia. They have. Your records and just deny on symptoms.  Word search is a great wayto find reasons deny   They refuse topay claims.  Why do I have e pet insurance? Especially when your pet is older. They have records to search anything and deny.  But the denial is not based on symptoms not actual pre existing conditions.  So will be canceling the money would be better saved in a bank account.  My cat may have a nasal tumor.  But because cat sneezes, not covered. Sneezing is a pre existing condition.  So ruling out nasal cancer is impossible beit requires a catscan and rhinoscope.Thats about $3500. On top of the 2k I paid.  But embrace does not see this as a condition that should be investigated.   If per sneezed the head is not covered.  if pet lost weight and latter a serious weight loss.Claims

Is pre existin.   If you have a young pet you might get reimbursed.  Older pets, will be denied.  The claims adjusters don’t seem

They will ignore what the vet writes and manufacture their own diagnosis that is literally the opposite of what the vet said. They will intentionally misinterpret statements to fit whatever narrative they want. 

From what I can tell, they're simply a scam.

Deeply regret giving this company any money.

Edit: Embrace's reply to my comment: ""We want to be upfront about our coverage and the exclusion of pre-existing conditions which is defined and agreed upon in our terms and conditions as""

What they DON'T TELL YOU is if you take your pet in for something that is covered, like an injury, and it shares one single SYMPTOM with something that is excluded, EMBRACE will diagnose your pet with a condition that is not covered. In my case their diagnosis was the exact opposite of what the vet listed.

If your pet cuts their paw and limps temporarily as a result, they can and will claim it's a skeletal or muscular condition. This means for the rest of your pet's life they will not be covered for any condition that could cause a limp.


Hopefully final edit: I wonder how many of the ""unqualified 8%"" of claims were qualified until Embrace put on their doctor's hat and fabricated a diagnosis from thin air? When they got tired of lying about my dog's diagnosis they smugly said that if the dog wasn't lame, then they couldn't cover the vet visit anyway, since it was a healthy dog! Not realizing what they'd just admitted to, I jumped at the chance.  

I told them sure, I'd gladly pay for the visit if it meant they couldn't use it against her for the rest of her life! They then went into backtrack mode immediately. Cancelled my policy.

Embrace doesn't seem very trustworthy.  
First of all, the 5 star reviews for this company look like fakes. All very similar in their descriptions and always only one or two sentences.  
The website already states that: ""Due to high call volume, there may be longer wait times.""
Unbelievable, they know that the customer will have to wait longer and instead of changing that, they just inform the customers. So, now you know, take it. 
And apparently you can only reach them by phone?!??
NO e-mail address? Companies without an email address are very suspicious, and there is a reason not to provide an email address. This makes it very difficult to prove anything later. The customer has no proof that they contacted the company.
One-time administration fee: $25.00
What do you have to pay $25 for ....? 
Customers should charge the company for completing the application. 

Answer for Embrace regarding your e-Mail address:
[Quote]Customer Care

Monday – Friday: 9 am – 8 pm ET

Saturday: 10 am – 2 pm ET

Phone: (855) 540-2104 Due to high call volume, longer hold times can occur.

I don't see any e-mail address under contact. 
And this is the right place for an email address and not hidden somewhere or only via app?

Answer regarding $25 fee:

If a company starts with a fee, what fees does the customer have to pay later? Complaint fees? Filing fees? Advertisement fees? it a Sunday fee? It's not a Sunday fee?

65d1661b9294fd2a19258463,False,False,"On 1/31/24, I submitted 4 claims for my dog.  One claim was handled correctly.  One was mishandled.  Two were automatically denied as duplicates, which they weren't.  In addition, a new claim was created inappropriately for services I never claimed.  To address all these problems, I had to call Embrace four separate times.  Each time, the Customer Service Representative (CSR) was knowledgeable and helpful.  What I realized was that the automated systems in place work very poorly.
Specifically, the automated system cannot handle documentation for more that one Date of Service at a time.  That is fine.  However, the instructions should be clear for owners to include documentation for only one Date of Service at a time.
Drontal Plus is typically a preventive medication. However, my dog was on it for treatment purposes.  My claim was initially denied automatically because Drontal Plus was the medication used. I supplied appropriate documentation to justify that Drontal Plus was being used as a treatment.  I had to call to request an adjustor read the documentation.  I should not have to do that.
I had two claims for Drontal Plus denied, despite providing documentation that is was used as a treatment medication.  After I called to request the first claim be approved, it was.  However, the second claim was automatically denied. I had to call again to ask an adjustor to review the second claim, even though a virtually identical claim had just been approved.
My suggestion is to have qualified human adjustor review the cases until the automatic processes are accurate.  At this point in time, the automatic processes are highly inaccurate.",2,Automate Review Process Highly Inaccurate,0,2024-02-01T00:00:00.000Z,2024-02-18T04:06:19.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/embracepetinsurance.com?page=9

65cfe4e6961869886187d5b2,False,False,"My honest review on Embrace over all would have to be a 3. I feel that generous due to the fact of the customer service and how the company overall can say a pet would have a condition that is considered by them as existing. I do feel if a veterinarian can state and even offered to send whatever he needed to confirm that my dog didn’t have any preexisting issues on something I shouldn’t be punished for that. I’m being told by your company whether that be with your customer service or whom that my dog had preexisting dental issue as well as eye issues etc. she hasn’t had any problems they thought possibly she may be having some allergy issues but they weren’t positive. So in result we decided we would try some things and see who she does. I was okay with the fact we started those before I went with Embrace. However, I feel after so long of not doing those things, I should be able to have that reviewed. Also, what’s being told to be a preexisting condition with her eyes, wasn’t and due to a scratch from a neighboring dog she happens to play with was the cause. However, I said I would do a surgery for her for that and I would pay completely. The dr stated she wouldn’t any longer have any problems with that after that, so when I stated what he said and he was willing to speak with anyone or send a letter whatever needed to provide that she wouldn’t any long have any issues with that problem…I call explain what he stated feeling after this was done we shouldn’t have any issues with anything else as for as eyes that could happen later down the road as for insurance wise, I’m told by Embrace once again that they will have no part anything with the eyes. So basically…at this time I feel like what am I even paying for?? Definitely nothing that helps when it comes to vet bills! So I would state caution on anyone considering….

He died having seizures and couldnt stop the first ones we had ever seen as he was a puppy and he died that way..with no help from them.  I spent 5k trying to save him over a three day ER period in Austin TX  He had a seizure that wouldnt end, suddenly at 3am.  It was covered.  They said somehow he was pre-existing? Even though all the vets and i said otherwise and all the records too...I mean he just was born a few months prior,  vets said this as well and we appealled...so disrespectful to my boy Waylon my love of a chocolate shih tzu.

65ce5ccfd863f6762d7e661d,False,False,"Insurance specialists seem poorly organized and not good at what they do, imho. (Maybe they are just overworked.) 

These are my following true experiences with them:
1. Insurance Specialist updated a claim 9 days after their initial document request that the claim was “pending request documentation delivery.” However, the vet sent it the same day they requested 7 9 days prior. The hospital forward me the email and send me the notes in case they still hadn’t receive them. Worse part was that day I had just spoken to someone at Embrace and they said they hadn’t received anything which is why my case was still pending. This urged me to call the vet’s office. 
2. My pet is a puppy. Mind you, we have gone to the vet mostly for routine care. Embrace had already requested all files pertaining to my fur baby. Yet, when I submitted a claim for an infection they requested all S.O.A.P notes because they have come to the realization that additional information was needed. This time it took them 21 days to realize they didn’t have all the files needed in order to process my claim. Once again, I go to my vets office and they showed me they had already send the requested documents.  
3. Embrace specialists also only handles one claim at a time, even if multiples have been submitted. 
4. In one of my claims, they sent the file request to an emergency hospital instead of my normal vet where the service occurred. When I called to find out the reason for this, they said all files need to be accessible in order to process the claim. We had gone once to this emergency hospital and it was for foreign object treatment. There’s no more notes from this hospital. Also, we submitted this claim so you already have the notes. A serious case of the left hand does not talk to the right. 
6. I’m still waiting refund for the one illness infection my puppy have because they are still “reviewing” my case. They said it’s only the first illness that will take a while - approximately 30 business days, however I’m still awaiting that first and only illness refunds. 

Overall, they are just okay in my book. I wish I would have made more research in Nextdoor for real feedback instead of potentially biased websites recommendations. Trupanion seems to be better at handling their cases as well as coverage. A little more expensive but worth it!

65c10c27693d2ca2fc085735,False,False,"Terrible Experience with Embrace - Strongly Advised Against

I am writing this review to share my extremely disappointing experience with Embrace. My interaction with them has been characterized by a questionable appeals process, selective use of information, and a blatant disregard for the evidence I provided.

One of the major issues I encountered was their appeals process, which seemed designed to be deliberately convoluted and unhelpful. Despite presenting solid evidence disputing their claim of a pre-existing condition in my pet, they continued to ignore the facts. Our initial vet misdiagnosed the condition, and we sought a second opinion that confirmed the error. However, Embrace persistently refused to acknowledge the correct diagnosis.
It became evident that the adjusters and underwriters selectively choose certain verbiage to suit their agenda of avoiding claim payouts. During my interactions with them, I was appalled to hear an adjuster suggest that I personally go back to the first vet for more information if I wanted to appeal again. This is not only unprofessional but completely absurd, as it is their responsibility to thoroughly investigate claims.

Furthermore, the company relies on policy terms and conditions, specifically #32 regarding pre-existing conditions, to justify their actions. However, it is crucial to note that our vet only officially diagnosed our dog after the policy was purchased. This fact seems conveniently overlooked, highlighting their unwillingness to consider the timeline of events and putting their profit over customer satisfaction.

In my pursuit of a fair resolution, I requested the cancellation of my policy. It is clear that Embrace prioritizes financial gain over ethical practices and customer welfare. I echo the sentiments of another reviewer who suggested that the company should employ vet techs. Ironically, one of our adjusters was a former vet tech, and this did not result in a more compassionate or customer-oriented approach.

In conclusion, I strongly caution against choosing Embrace for your pet insurance needs. Their unscrupulous tactics, disregard for evidence, and lack of customer-centric values make them an unreliable and unethical choice. I encourage pet owners to explore alternative options with more reputable and ethical pet insurance providers.

*edit since they responded*: I am no longer in contact with anyone from their company since I cancelled my policy since they have refused to review the appeal in its entirety. They claim they “ultimately go off medical records” during the claims and appeals process. I will reiterate in my review above that they have disregarded the misdiagnoses as well as  the appeal letter from the doctor.

As a family with six cats, we were impressed with how quickly Embrace responded to emergencies once the initial claim is processed.

Unfortunately, our experience renewing our insurance has not been similarly pleasant. We were shocked to find our policy had increased from $80 to $113 per month for 5 cats. The only claim we made (that was covered) was Rutabaga's inoperable tumor.
We have spoken to customer service twice about this, and no one was receptive to our complaint – probably because it is obvious that we’d be on the hook for new pre-existing conditions if we were to change insurance providers. We strongly recommend thinking carefully about who you get your pet insurance from.

We got this for our puppy, whom of course you hope your puppy is healthy , but with enrolling, they put you into a area of hold,(if you will) while the puppy is processed and checked through with vet records. While this was occurring by pup got a limp/knee buckle at 4 months. So, I get him checked  and our vet saw nothing wrong. So I asked for a referral to a specialist, 2 week wait, and she tells me my puppy he has elbow dysplasia. Well, I want a second opinion and we went to that appt., and they determined the same diagnosis and that a bi-lateral arthroscope surgery would be best. We agree to the surgery and then the 4-6 weeks of restricted rest. During this time I send in his claims from ALL vets. They tell my upon reviewing the records, that because he had ""a limp"" this is a pre-existing condition and they will NOT cover any of the expense. So, I should let you know, if you get a puppy and you hope for a good pet insurance, this is not for you!!! How was I to know this puppy had genetics that were bad with elbow dysplasia? Both parents showed no signs, nor  in their lineage either. But it happened and this puppy is loved and cared for and we now have a pup with a life long condition without any insurance. This puppy was only 4 months old when I discovered his limp, and 6 months old at surgery and 7 months when they tell me they won't cover him!! So think long and hard about getting Embrace!

Well, in January 2024, my monthly fee increased from 49 to 79 dollars (rounded amounts). I called them and of course they blamed inflation, which as Robert Reich points out is actually price gouging. Corporations are blaming inflation to squeeze every penny they can from their customers to line the pockets of shareholders and executive staff. They also rely on vet techs and those with ""demonstrated vet experience"" rather than actual veterinarians! So they base all their insurance decisions on non-vets, who while may be great vet techs and the like, but they are NOT qualified to be making medical based decisions to inform insurance professionals.

657f1abdd768dbce5a6ea4d4,False,False,"We were cautiously optimistic that the pet insurance we paid good money for would finally be useful when our pup was diagnosed with a soft-tissue sarcoma months after we started our coverage. But, like all insurance companies, Embrace did everything possible to avoid holding up their side of the deal. They denied our claim for surgery and treatment with a hollow and absolutely pathetic argument about their pre-existing conditions policy. 

Just understand that they will, without a doubt, weasel their way out of any obligation they have to cover your pet. And they’ll do it shamelessly, with the most mealy-mouthed legalese imaginable. Maybe the most pathetic thing about Embrace, though, is their utterly transparent lack of competence. While they deceitfully attempted to explain why they are denying our rightful claim to the coverage we paid for, they made blatant errors about the most basic facts of the case/claim (e.g., which side of the body the tumor was on, which anatomical space the tumor was on, etc.).

Don’t make the same mistake we did buying Embrace pet insurance. You’re better off paying out of pocket from the start, since that’s what you’ll be doing anyway.

As someone who at one point who had 2 dogs on the policy that both went through quite a lot of heath issues, I got tired of the nitpick from Embrace on just about everything. Most was about denial because ""it's not USDA approved treatment"" but they will cover drugs that are not FDA approved for use in your pets. Customer Service gives you lip service and at times can be quite patronizing. Ask to speak with a claims adjuster they take a message to have someone call you back and hear nothing. The hold time is beyond 20 minutes to reach customer service. My favorite from customer service is ""submit a claim and see if it's a covered service"". Why this company even bothers to have customer service is beyond me. Also, what they will not tell you when you sign up is the amount of money per month you will pay with an older pet. My monthly premium for one dog went from $250.00 a month at age 10 to $355.00 a month at age 11. Paying claims within 10 to 15 business days results in waiting for a payment for as long as 21 days.

They will not pay your claim. They will make it as painful as possible and will drag it out as long as they can to get you to give up. They will throw up roadblocks, ignore you, and ultimately find some weak loophole to deny your claim.

We lost our dog recently, and very unexpectedly. She evidently had heart cancer of a type known to be a sudden killer. There was no evidence of this illness prior to us taking her to the vet due to a cough. We made medical decisions based on the fact we had insurance and were past our ""waiting period"". 

Embrace not only denied paying anything and left me holding a $5000 bill, but they made me relive the entire thing every time I was forced to deal with their awful adjusters over months and months. My dog has been seeing the same vet regularly for 10 years. We saw an emergency vet and a veterinary cardiologist. All of them stated that even if our dog had been seen a just week before her illness manifest, no one would have found it and it would have been too late by months anyway. Classifying her illness as ""pre-existing"" is laughable, and all three vets were shocked when told.

6567c594038dffe636e9dca3,False,False,"Before having pet insurance, I assumed it was all a scam. However, I recently put both my cats under Embrace's coverage and could not have been more wrong. I assumed my 10 year old rescue might have some issues come up in the next couple years, so both her and my 4 year old cat are covered. About a month after getting them covered, the 4 year old cat has needed multiple vet visits in a single week for sudden onset of kidney issues. Embrace has covered 90% of all charges after the small deductible I had selected, saving me half a month's pay!  It will take 5 years of monthly payments for both cats until I break even on the coverage provided this past week. I am amazed at the ease of submitting a claim and the speed at which it is processed. Having a sick baby is stressful enough without worrying about finances, and that worry has been lifted from me by Embrace.

654e4cf7876b41ebd611f98c,False,False,"One of the Best Investments I've ever made in Insurance. The price of emergency care has sky rocketed. Last year I had a friend that adapted a puppy. After 4 months of bliss his puppy got cancer. Long story short puppy is doing well but it took 3 months of surgery's, chemo (yes chemo) and many visits to Vet and Vet hospital. For real his Vet bills totaled over $16,000. So when we got our puppy this year I checked into animal insurance. I heard all the horror stories that the animal insurance companies never pay but after extensive research and quotes I felt Embrace was the best bang for the buck. I've had pets before and hardly ever needed a Vet for other than basic wellness but my friends experience made me choose to try it out. My puppy policy was not very expensive at all. Needless to say my puppy at 6 months old was either stung by a bee or bit by a snake (never saw what did it to her) and she went into anaphylactic shock and almost died. Well the Vet hospital bill and follow up was over $2500. Embrace paid their contracted share within 2 weeks ($1800 or 90% after my $500 deductable), directly to my bank account. After initial required documentation from me they did all the legwork with the Hospital and Vet. Best thing of all was when the Hospital told me what was needed to save our puppy I didn't flinch about proceeding with the procedures, figuring that's why I got insurance. After all was said and done It sure was nice to know I didn't have to have our puppy either put down or take on an enormous amount of debt to save her. The peace of mind was such a relief.

654b8aee3abc500569673c4e,False,False,"For anyone looking for pet insurance, please make sure they tell you what is covered and not covered from the beginning, check what your pet's pre existing conditions are and what is NOT covered based on that. 

I enrolled with embrace hoping to have some peace of mind in case my cat ever needed veterinary care, they did a vet history check where they get your pet's records and determine what's covered and if there are any pre-existing conditions that won't be covered. At the time of enrollment I did not receive notice of conditions that would not be covered. 

I paid for my cat's Accident & Illness policy for basically a year. She got sick about a month ago (lethargic, vomit, diarrhea) I took her to the vet and she got treated for those symptoms with antibiotics, anti-inflammatories along with an x-ray that showed a possible soft tissue mass in her abdomen. 

When I submitted the claim, they said they had to do another Vet history check and this second time they stated that treatment for any mass including cancer would not be covered because my cat had a mass in her ear years ago according to her vet history. I wonder if they did not communicate this to me with the first history check so that I would keep the policy and then they could deny whatever treatment once a claim is submitted under the pretext of a 'second history check is needed'.

So I had to cover the $730 bill out of pocket on top of paying for all the insurance premiums for a year which were an absolute waste of money. I cancelled the policy because any treatment moving forward would be linked to that and not covered obviously. 

Fast forward, I've taken my cat to the vet once again, and they stated that what looked like a mass is instead an enlarged kidney and she has an infection, we still need more testing to determine the exact cause. The bill is at $1500 right now but that number keeps growing, I will do anything for my cat but I'd be lying if I said these events don't affect you big time financially. 

My recommendation if you're searching for insurance: Get everything in writing from the start, what's covered and what's not, read the fine print and ask for clarification on anything you don't understand and lastly but the most important piece of advise, BUILD AN EMERGENCY FUND for your pet, save what you can while they're healthy to cover vet expenses when they're not.

654abfd184e65804a7c1049c,False,False,"DO NOT do business with Embrace.  A different company American Modern Home Insurance owns it and handles the claims. Its adjusters will do whatever it takes to deny substantial claims like mine of $3,800. They like to stretch the “pre-existing condition” clause. Look at some of the other one-star reviews. They don’t apparently consult with veterinarians.
After a routine teeth cleaning in February 2023, my cat Jenny almost died because she had become completely incapable of chewing food. We took her back to her original vet, two emergency vets, and a vet neurology specialist. They decided it was a neurological problem that was preventing her from chewing properly even though she tried.  They said something happened during the cleaning such as too much anesthetic. We had to feed her through a tube for more than two weeks until she very slowly regained her ability.

Jenny was given to me at 6 years old. I knew she had never had her teeth cleaned and  that this was important to do routinely. I told the vet who looked in Jenny’s mouth and said nothing other than that the cleaning would be scheduled.

It turns out the vet put in her notes that Jenny had gingivitis. This was before I got Insurance. I would have had the cleaning even there had been no gingivitis. Embrace denied all claims based on this even after two appeals during which they received three letters from the vets involved stating gingivitis had nothing to do with the problem. How could it? It was an accident or mistake that occurred during the cleaning.

Here is my reply to your reply. The gingivitis was not medically related to my cat's neurological injury. That is what two of my vets told you. There was an injury to her nerves suffered during the teeth cleaning. The only connection to the gingivitis was that it preceded the cleaning chronologically. There was no medical causation.

654404bf04ced44d03809f25,False,False,"Where do I begin... I got embrace $15k coverage in the worst case scenario for both my cats. I did a ton of research and they provided dental illness, waived exams if you paid for it, and had a deal for multiple cats. The only red flags were several reviewers said they had a tendency to really exaggerate and define everything as a prexisting condition.

Nothing happened for 3-4 months after receiving coverage. Then on a vet visit, my vet noticed my cat had loss weight. For my first vet visit claim, I found out they had never bothered to review my pets medical records and proceeded to start adding ticky tacky ""pre-existing conditions"" which included something such as slightly dirty teeth now being an exclusion for dental diseases. I literally purchased them partially because they were one of the few companies that covered dental diseases. But apparently that has a massive asterisk to it.

The best part about my first claim? It took 1.5 months for them to start telling me anything and only after i had to reach out to embrace and the vets because apparently they were just going to string me along until i did anything. So basically i paid them for 4.5 months only to find out they were going to start adding ineligibility.

Flash forward to today 3 months from my first claim, I still havent been paid yet. My cat is now dead. I am now finding out not only did they take 2.5 months to make their first decision on my pets claim, they have suddenly reversed decision and telling me im not paying squat. Between dealing with my pets health issues and death, I have to be the one constantly badgering the insurance company and reaching out to the vets to get information. Not only did i have to stress about my cat, i had to deal with this absolute dog poop of a company that has dragged its feet for anything just to screw me at every turn. I have spoken to probably 4 people at the company so far and im likely going to speak to a 5th.

If you want an insurance company that will ultimately not pay you, expect you to do all the work yourself, try to put anything and everything as exclusionary, and just add stress to you while your pet is dying. Then yeah Embrace is for you.

What a frigging scam. Im canceling my other pets insurance policy. I have 0 trust if anything happened with my other cats they wouldn't find a way to bend me over here too. Could not recommend a company less - end to end, just completely screwing me. I guess its better i find out now, because apparently if my cat had gotten sick 5 years from now they would have told me after collecting 5 years of checks they would just absolutely screw me. What the actual hell. 0 stars if i could.

653bef012f0c0e820b2ee8c8,False,False,I don’t like to give bad reviews unless they earned it.  This company has more than earned it.  I paid $3000 for 2 dogs for the year and I haven’t been to aggressive with filing claims.  $1000 deductible so figure will only do it with big issues.  My pup had radiation for cancer in her lung $30k precondition no complaint not covered didn’t even try.  Well she had a medical emergency while at radiation she bit down on stela cage after treatment.  The DR paid for her to go to dental surgeon again nothing out of pocket for Embrace.  While there they found a life threatening non cancerous tumor that had grow in back of her mouth.  They wanted $3000 to remove and test.  I expected not much but some of this to be covered.  Filed claim 3 weeks ago.  I have 13 years worth of medical docs.  That wasn’t enough they are going through with fine comb wanting every ER visit in last 12 months even if they found something in last 12 month she was covered for this 12 months but they are being completely ridiculous. My renewal is Monday and I told them no way no how.   I suspected them to cover maybe 500-1000 of the $3000 because of one excuse or another but I had no idea just to the extent they would hit pick and they to weasel out of 1 CLAIM for 1 dog out of the whole year for 2 dogs.   They care more about left wing social justice groups than the animals they claim to insure.  Don’t take my word just read up on the companies website there yearly report on their company.  Their agent wasn’t as snobby and elitest as one might expect.  If I could give them negative rating I would they are so bad.  I love my pups and if you are reading this review I imagine you do to.  Don’t risk it they are as bad as if not worst than that competitor Truepanion.   I was able to cover the radiation because I had saved the money over the years from being burned by any time I ever purchased insurance and tried to use it.  There is a reason they make you pay up front and reimburse and that is cause they know there is a near 99% chance they can find some way to get out of it if your dog is older than one week and has maintained sufficient medical records.,1,I don’t like to give bad reviews unless earnes,1,2023-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,2023-10-27T19:10:25.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/embracepetinsurance.com?page=41

She said I could speak with a licensed agent and adjust my coverage to get my premium down.

I read the reviews on each, listed to others complaints and made sure not to make the same mistakes they did.  I took my new puppy to the vet within two weeks of signing up, got them to fill out the orthopedic review form, and then at the end of the 14 day waiting period for accident/illness had my vet sent over my pets complete medical records to Embrace and requested they review her history for any pre-existing conditions and advise me of their findings, exclusions if any.  After that, I signed up for direct deposit reimbursement, any claims I needed to file have been acknowledged within 7 days and reimbursed super promptly within the next 5-7 days, no muss no fuss.

Unexpectedly, Embrace has now than doubled the yearly cost and wants me to pay over $1300 a year for the same coverage. I tried to call to talk to someone at Embrace about this, but they were unable to help and only offered to ""change my coverage around"" which would only reduce the cost by a couple hundred or so and increase my deductible etc. I understand costs can rise, inflation, pet age, etc. However, more than double isn't right. $1373 for one dog with a $700 deductible is wild...why am I paying more for one pets insurance than my own car or health insurance? 

I want to change providers, however, I'm aware most insurance companies won't cover any illnesses that arose during the coverage period of previous insurer, essentially leaving the insured with little to no options to go elsewhere if they want to stay covered for the same conditions. I think this is pretty unfair to the little guy, scummy, rigged, and not   a practice of integrity.

Embrace shouldn't feel good about these practices. More than doubling, the cost of insurance isn't acceptable, but they do this knowing once you're locked in you can't really switch to another provider.

Also, I've had to fight tooth and nail to have previous claims covered, go through lengthy appeals processes, etc. They take their sweet time and try to deny you when you rightfully submit claims.

65066e6e562bcb7232e9db53,False,False,"I’d had a policy for both of my sweet dogs for two years before I had to file my first claim.

In July 2023, my precious boy Wrinkles was suddenly diagnosed with a large tumor in his chest as well as pleural effusion. Over the next 30 days, we did everything absolutely possible to try to extend his life for many more great years.

Unfortunately, by the time we drove down to Colorado State University to meet with the oncologists to develop an action plan, though, Wrinkles started to decline rapidly. 
He was hospitalized in their critical care unit for 36 hours with the hope to stabilize him so we could move forward with treatment. 
The tumor grew so fast during that time, however, that he became unable to breathe without assistance. His body could not fight anymore. 

We had to make the massively difficult, painful decision to have him put to sleep there, surrounded by his family with many hugs and kisses, after enjoying some delicious treats and tasty bison wet food. 

In our hearts, the only thing more painful than choosing to have him put down with all of us there holding him and loving him would have been him dying alone in that oxygen cage while waiting for stabilization and further steps with oncology. 

Because of Embrace, from the moment of his diagnosis, we were able to say YES to everything recommended by his veterinarian, from the additional appointments here in North Dakota to the fine needle aspirate to the biopsy to the multiple chest x-rays and abdominal ultrasounds as well as the steroids. We were also able to go to CSU with Wrinkles without even blinking an eye, knowing that there was no concern with how much treatment would cost. All that truly mattered was that we were going to do everything we could to get this tumor removed so he could live the rest of his beautiful life.

It is devastating beyond words that this cancer progressed so fast that we couldn’t beat it. But thanks to Embrace, again, I know we did all we humanly could. 

About one week after Wrinkles’ passing, I did the painful work of submitting his records and filing the claims. I did not know what to expect. Of course, I was a bit scared of the worst case scenario that Embrace was either going to ask a lot of questions and give me a hard time during this devastating chapter of my life, or even find some components of his treatment not to pay for, for some reason.

After just a handful of days, however, Embrace deposited the contractually stated 80% of Wrinkles’ medical bills into my bank account. In a time of searing grief and sadness, this was one small bright spot- to be able to pay off his bills right then. 

Thank you, Embrace. We really do appreciate you.",5,Embrace keeps their word,0,2023-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,2023-09-17T05:11:42.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/embracepetinsurance.com?page=50

64fced71a59a23ba58f671bb,False,False,"Embrace is a total waste of time and money. I had coverage on two dogs for more than two years at $73/month. Not ONE TIME did Embrace pay out a claim. Their underwriters flatly lied when I asked them to apply a vet bill to my annual deductible, claiming a veterinarian’s exam description of “Minor gum swelling; overdue for cleaning” actually means “indicative of gum disease; preexisting condition.” 

In fact, when I went to file a claim after over a year, they told me that my paperwork hadn’t been finished when I set up my account. You mean you sat there and collected $70 every month and never bothered to tell me that my account wasn’t properly set up? Thank god my dogs weren’t injured and needed emergency medical treatment during that time. 

I gave these useless clowns $1700 and got absolutely nothing for it. I paid for every vet visit and every scrap of medication. They refused to cover ANYTHING, finding loopholes and ridiculous reasons not to pay out until I finally canceled coverage. You are better served putting $75 a month into a savings account and using that to pay for your pets’ medical coverage as needed. 

They offer ridiculous contact times… They literally have an emergency number on their website that is only answered Monday through Friday, 8a-3p Eastern Standard Time— because god forbid you have an emergency over the weekend. I had exactly ONE email out of a dozen replied to in two years. Let’s be frank: Embrace doesn’t care about you or your pet. They sure make certain to bill you on time, though.

I’m a capitalist. I’m all in favor of a company making money, provided that they provide a service that is WORTH the money. Embrace does NOT. 

On March 22nd, 2023, Embrace was reported to the Pierce County, WA Better Business Bureau for fraudulent insurance practices. As of the writing of this review, 09September, 2023, they had failed to even respond to the report. They managed to contact me immediately when I deleted my credit card from their app and they felt it was time to be paid, though. (The app features no way to cancel your coverage via the app.)

In short, do not purchase Embrace medical coverage for any pet you actually care about. They will NOT be there when you need them. Your beloved pets could DIE while these bozos find reasons not to help you.",1,Embrace is a total waste of time and…,0,2023-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,2023-09-10T00:10:57.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/embracepetinsurance.com?page=52

64d14de1356431f256a2f4e9,False,False,"Dear Pet Owners,

I am writing this review to share my unfortunate experience with Embrace Pet Insurance and to caution prospective customers about potential challenges with their services. My aim is to provide an honest account of the issues I encountered with the company.

After our beloved 8-year-old Shih Tzu dog fell ill and required emergency care, we faced an $800 out-of-pocket expense as our previous pet plan did not cover such situations. To ensure better coverage for future incidents, we decided to explore other pet insurance options and settled on Embrace due to their endorsement by USAA. We enrolled our dog into their program and dutifully submitted all of her medical records for their review.

Approximately four months ago, our dog received a misdiagnosis of a mass in one of her eyes, leading us to consult an eye specialist. Fortunately, the diagnosis was found to be incorrect, and our dog was diagnosed with a yeast infection around the eye area instead. We promptly submitted our claim, only to be informed that it would not be covered due to a preexisting condition. Despite our dog requiring several follow-up visits, each incurring $180 in expenses, our claims were consistently denied on the same grounds.

In an effort to resolve the matter, we sought our veterinarian's professional opinion during one of our appointments, and they confirmed that the condition our dog experienced was unrelated to the preexisting condition cited by Embrace for the denials. To bolster our appeal, the veterinarian provided supporting documentation affirming the distinction between the two conditions. However, despite our efforts, we were met with a generic response from Embrace, persisting that our dog's coverage would not be extended due to the alleged preexisting condition.

Our frustration grew as subsequent communications with Embrace remained unyielding, and we reached out to express our concerns about their stance. Regrettably, we received a standardized, unaltered response, leading us to question the company's customer service, communication, and overall policies.

As a result, we find ourselves locked into a year-long contract with Embrace, obligating us to continue paying the monthly fee of $70 despite our dissatisfaction with the service provided. Our family invested in a product that has not delivered as expected, leaving us disappointed with the entire experience.

In conclusion, I earnestly advise prospective pet owners to think twice before considering Embrace Pet Insurance. While we initially hoped for a positive and reliable experience, our journey with the company has left us dissatisfied with their policies and the level of service received.

I hope this review serves as a valuable reference during your research for suitable pet insurance companies. We believe it is crucial to make informed decisions when it comes to protecting our beloved animal companions.

Sincerely,

John

Received this response on August 17, 2023 from Embrace regarding our negative experience.  My response to their response is...
WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD...Several emails regarding rejected claim(s) (plural) with questions about denials were sent and were always replied to with canned responses stating 'pre-existing condition'.  We pointed out what the veterinarian scribed in the Dr.s notes stating otherwise and were still denied any reimbursement.  My advice to anyone considering Embrace as their choice for pet insurance is if you are transferring to Embrace with any kind of medical history on your pet, go elsewhere. I may as well be holding $70 dollars over a candle flame every month and get the same results.",1,Unsatisfactory Experience,0,2023-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,2023-08-07T22:02:41.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/embracepetinsurance.com?page=60

I was  ready for the expected run-around and request for ""more information"", ""more paper work"", ""time to review"" and not having access to the funds (which insurance or not, my puppy would have gotten his care no question about it), requiring mayor life adjustments. 1 week later my claims were still waiting to be in review status, I sent an email requesting an update and the response I got back 5 days later was not what I expected. Five (5) of my seven (7) claims were resolved and approved for reimbursement! 1 week later 5 claims were already reimbursed. No not, the ones with the lowest ammount, surprisngly as it might be, maybe a coinsidence, but the highest amount claims were paid first! (1 claim alone was over 8,000 USD!!)

The last claim, which was one with one of the lower amounts took a little bit to get resolved. Somehow the receipt kept getting ""lost"" or could not be found.

64c946abc85cb7ba34ec2038,False,False,"Embrace has exceptional coverage and customer service.  We purchased insurance for our dog when she was just a puppy and luckily she was very healthy for a long time.  I even considered canceling so many times because she was so healthy and I thought we were wasting money.  I am so thankful we kept it!  At 8 years old she was diagnosed with Type I diabetes.  The initial testing to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other issues was quite expensive and everything was covered.  Additionally, we had the constant costs of insulin, syringes, a blood glucose monitor & testing strips, sharps containers and periodic emergency visits for concerns relating to her diabetes.  EVERYTHING was covered and claims were processed quickly and easily.  On top of this, a year after her diagnosis she developed a tumor in her mouth which had to be removed.  She had to have about an inch and a half of her bottom front jaw removed to get rid of all the tumor.  This was about $5500 just for the surgery and again all of it was covered.  Even though the surgery went well and she recovered quickly, just 3 months later she stopped eating.  We initially thought it was pancreatitis (as a result of her diabetes) and all of the testing, treatment, etc did not help.  She spent 3-4 days at the vet's office with them doing everything they could to help her.  During an ultrasound, they discovered a mass on her spleen which turned out to be lymphoma. At this point we had to make the decision to let her go peacefully but the cost of the previous weeks trying to help her were quite high. Once again, EVERYTHING was covered.  Knowing this throughout all of these ordeals made it so easy for us to do whatever we needed to help her without worry of a sudden and unexpected costs to us.

I did a lot of research before deciding on Embrace and a big reason I decided to go with them is because I saw many reviews saying that they generally reimbursed well. As with most of you reading this, I did not want to pay a pet insurance for months only to find out that when the time came, there were a bunch of loopholes for them to avoid reimbursement.

I started with them at the end of 2021 and was so glad I did because a few months later one of my dogs began having a lot of health issues. The hospital bill ran into the thousands and Embrace covered almost all of it. 
They review claims quickly and have a quick turnaround for reimbursement. They also have great customer service and respond quickly if you have any follow up questions. Only thing to keep in mind is that you do have to pay out of pocket first and then will receive the reimbursement either through a check in the mail or direct deposit.

Regarding some pre-existing conditions, some of them (for example periodontal disease or anal sac impaction) expire once your pet receives treatment for it (e.g., dental cleaning, anal gland expression) so even if they initially did not cover a claim for this reason, it became eligible for reimbursement after the first time they receive treatment for it.

Not only did they demonstrate a complete lack of understanding regarding my cat's health, but they also cunningly labeled common conditions as permanent pre-existing conditions. Allow me to elaborate on my nightmarish journey with Embrace.

First and foremost, my cat developed chin acne, a relatively common and easily treatable condition 11 months ago which completely disappeared a month later.  However, when I submitted a claim for his ear infection  issue, Embrace shockingly saw fit to classify it as a permanent pre-existing condition. (To not cover his ear infection claim) Chin acne, really? How can an insurance provider deem a temporary skin condition as permanent? It became abundantly clear that Embrace was determined to avoid covering anything related to my cat's well-being from the start. When the vet saw this they nearly had a heart attack. They told me to part ways immediately. 

Adding insult to injury, Embrace went on to claim that my cat had another permanent pre-existing condition—periodontal disease. The audacity! My cat, who is only 3 years old and as healthy as ever, does not have periodontal disease. I literally have medical documents and the word of my trusted veterinarian to back this up. Yet Embrace turned a blind eye to this evidence, refusing to acknowledge the truth and using it as an excuse to deny coverage.

Embrace's blatant disregard for factual medical records and their tendency to classify every minor issue as a permanent pre-existing condition is a clear indication of their unethical practices. It is evident that their primary goal is to collect premiums without providing any meaningful coverage for our beloved pets.

Throughout my interactions with Embrace, their customer service was abysmal. They were unresponsive, dismissive, and lacked empathy. It felt as if they were intentionally trying to discourage me from pursuing my rightful claims. Dealing with Embrace only added to the stress and frustration of dealing with my cat's health issues.

In conclusion, I strongly advise against purchasing Embrace Pet Insurance. Their unfair classification of common and treatable conditions as permanent pre-existing conditions, along with their refusal to acknowledge legitimate medical evidence, showcases their true colors. Save yourself the headache, disappointment, and financial loss by seeking out a reputable pet insurance provider that values transparency, fairness, and the well-being of your furry companions. Embrace Pet Insurance is an absolute letdown and should be avoided at all costs. 

Thank god ive only been with them for like 3 months. 


***Also they are not crystal clear with what they cover. A simple exam that appeared to be covered in the beginning was denied because “I didnt initially sign up with the wellness rewards” - They manipulate the way they advertise/market.

You’re required to submit certain documents in order to even get the insurance, including a full medical history, plus a new physical exam for your pet in order to secure the insurance. So why they need all of this information submitted with every single claim is beyond me! It is a hassle to you and to the vet because they literally have it all on file. But why do they do it; to delay, delay, delay and ultimately to place on hold or deny any illness claims you submit. When asked where are the documents, you’ll never receive a response. It’s never a hassle for them to take your money, but always one when it’s time for them to pay up. I’d never recommend them for illness coverage. You’ll be paying them and the medical bills, when you can just pay the medical bills, because you’ll never see a dime back from them. The wellness prevention package is worth it because it’s basically like a loan of your money upfront. But guess what; that’s an add on service so you can’t purchase it without the illness coverage.

Insurance is a necessary evil.  It's better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it as the saying goes.  So having a reputable and competent provider is a must.  Embrace is that company.  Their affiliation with USAA gives you confidence that they are a legitimate service provider.  Their website is user friendly.  Their customer service is friendly (and U.S. based from what I have experienced) You can customize your policy to fit your pet(s) needs.  You can tweak your policy to get a premium/deductible that works for your budget.  Claims are straightforward and easy enough to submit.  

Bottomlime, Embrace is an all around great company.  I checked out many others before settling on them a few years ago.  Since then I have been perfectly happy with them.  They give you peace of mind when it comes to something as stressful as pet insurance.  I would fully reccomend them other pet parents!",5,Peace of Mind Pet Insurance,0,2023-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,2023-07-15T18:43:43.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/embracepetinsurance.com?page=65

They have a lot of options to choose from too… you can choose your annual deductible, annual reimbursement limit, and your reimbursement percentage.  You also have the option for exam fees and prescription drugs.  Depending on how you make your annual plan these add-on’s are cheap and worth it.

If you wait until there is a sickness or emergency, those will be considered as pre-existing conditions (just like any insurance policy) and any sickness related to pre-existing conditions will not be covered.

You are happily getting overpaid with the money Embrace steals from their customers. They are full of $#it!! Do not, I mean DO NOT sign up with this company. The customer service is ridiculous… they are literally trained to deal with upset consumers. They all have a script and only say “I’m sorry but….”. When asked to transfer to a supervisor they will tell you that there are none available due to attending a meeting”. They screwed thee crap out of me. My dog is dead and all because they said her diagnosis was pre existing, based off a previous visit that she had been seen for prior to coverage. They denied me but said if I could have the vet send an email to confirm the previous appointment had nothing to do with her illness diagnosis from a year ago!!! I, unfortunately, could not afford the vet bills(hence the point of insurance)… or Atleast I thought. I doubt there is more than 3% of customers that receive reimbursement for long term illnesses… and those are probably only because they signed up when their pet had NEVER been to a vet. Once I proved the prior visit had nothing to do with the current one… they dug up some BS old appointment from a year ago and made some excuse as to why they missed it during the review process. I will be taking Embrace to court. Praise the Lord I work for a law firm that deals with insurance companies!!! I hope that I can have more people back me up in this lawsuit… and we can all win a settlement. This is NO JOKE… the legal process has already begun. 

As stated at the beginning of my review… DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS REVIEW U LESS YOU ADMIT ALL GUILT and REIMBURSE ME FOR MY PUPS VET BILLS… along with the pain and suffering from the loss of our beloved furbaby that meant the world to us!!! RIH our beautiful baby girl… I hope Embrace looses everything in this settlement! If you respond to this email, you are admitting guilt, and it will be used in court.

Lots of jumping through impossible hoops. No reimbursement. We live in a rural setting. She has never been injured. The problem is my vet does not use SOAP notes. The vet does provide medical records but not in the form all insurances require. FINALLY! This customer service made that clear. I can never have my pet claims reimbursed for a reason I learned after a year of premiums. We love our dog and our vet. The insurance constraints make her uncoverable. We hope to have her for years. Very frustrating as no one told me the SOAP requirement but gladly took my money. I had to research vet procedural requirements and contact my rural but wonderful vet to determine the problem. ASK YOUR VET AND YOUR PROSPECTIVE INSURANCE BEFORE YOU PAY FOR INSURANCE. Our pet is not uninsurable because of an unspoken requirement. 1) Your vet is an amazing  practitioner but does not conform to the insurance software/paper compliance. You won’t ever receive reimbursement. 2) Your insurance company will not tell you up front that the SOAP medical records system is mandatory. Handwritten or typed medical records are useless to an insurance company. My beloved pet’s life and future pain unimportant to the insurance company because of our rural location. 3) What exemption will you discover? Having paid all her premiums timely, they were for naught. I suppose insurances will require Electronic Medical Records next. Which will truly be absurd. My pet is uninsured despite our efforts and great care. Buyer beware! Wasted money. No security for my girl. All because of paper compliance. I didn’t know to ask about SOAP to either vet or insurance company. I can guarantee you the vet prices will be higher if specific software is demanded. I’ve wasted far too much time on this already. My pet is still at risk! 4) Embrace did refund my first premium but I was not informed of SOAP requirements until I educated myself.

They give multi-pet discounts and were recommended the best deal for my aging dog. What looked promising on the outside differs from that once you are a member of this company. They will go to whatever lengths necessary to question and deny your claims. I would not recommend this company to anyone who has ever taken their pet to a veterinarian and/or has any kind of medical history. Health conditions that seem unrelated? They will dig through your pet’s medical history, find a connection, and refuse to reimburse you. 

I had a 10-month-old puppy for whom I enrolled with Embrace at six months. He swallowed a squeaker a few weeks ago. I took him for scans and imaging, which were inconclusive. But we knew after an exhaustive search of our home he ate it, and we saw him eat it. Embrace refused to cover these items because I had taken my puppy in for vomiting before signing up for Embrace, which was labeled a “temporary pre-existing condition” for one year. Because he swallowed a foreign body and was vomiting due to it, any treatment was considered a “pre-existing temporary condition.” Just this week, an endoscopy located the squeaker, they removed it surgically, and now I have to go back and dispute that initial exam that involved x-rays and imaging. I’m also crossing my toes and fingers that they will cover the removal of the squeaker and not find that he has a “temporary pre-existing condition” of being a puppy who swallows stuff. 

This week, we had to take my six-year-old dog in for lethargy and not eating. I submitted the claim, and now they are doing a review of her medical history 12 months before signing up her up for Embrace. I’m sure they will find something. They must have thousands of adjusters locked up in a big warehouse somewhere pouring over pet medical records. Yes, these claims may eventually all be covered, but I’ve spent a lot of time and heartache requesting letters from vets, asking they follow up with Embrace, and on the phone with Embrace. Even if they are covered, I will likely return to Healthy Paws, which I wish I had never left.

Took her in for an ultrasound & they found a large mass attached to her uterus which required surgery. Luckily they got it all & it was benign. Embrace without any problems paid 90% of her bills minus the deductible within about a week. After never needing them for almost 6 yrs I had to question how much push back I would get & honestly it went very smooth. Submitted all my bills online & they followed through. It was quite a large bill as surgery & 2 ultra sounds with a lung x-ray does add up. The only part they didn't pay for was her medication at the onset as I don't have medication coverage. Although they did pay for the oral meds during her surgery & her nights stay at the hospital for observation which I feel is important as bringing a dog home 5 hrs., after a major surgery to me is not wise. The only thing I wish is they didn't limit you to 10,000.00 a yr per pet by the policy you choose, 10,000.00 seems like a lot until you experience something like this.

I insured my dogs with no pre-existing conditions (except for seasonal allergies for our boy dog) and they were receiving excellent and regular vet care from the top rated vet practice in our city. My girl got a ruptured disc and had to have very expensive surgery, along with medications and special equipment post surgery. We were so relieved that we had pet insurance. You could have scraped us off the floor when our claim was denied. They said our dog had an ""UNDIAGNOSED pre-existing condition"" Our vet couldn't believe it. She sent letters, e-mailed and called multiple times telling them and proving that this was not something that could be considered pre-existing. We appealed three times and each time they denied it. Be aware. . .they do not have Vets in their company to review medical information. So the people that are looking these claims are just everyday people off the street with no experience working with animals. My dog's breed is not known for having this condition. We took it to our State Insurance Board. After reviewing the information, they agreed with us that the condition could not have been pre-existing. Although they could not force Embrace to pay in our state, the investigator recommended it and the company again said no. The investigator recommended that we sue, and we probably will do just that, because we have compelling evidence that our dog did not have a pre-existing condition.  If you decide to use Embrace after this review, just know that they will worm out of every opportunity to pay for necessary and life saving surgery. Then you, after paying for insurance, will be left with a big bill that may take you a long time to pay off. It is hard to make the choice between saving your pet and knowing that you will be incurring debt that may affect you for a long time, even though you did the right thing and bought pet insurance that you thought would protect you. To be honest, it is my goal to tell every person about our awful experience with Embrace, so that they don't fall into the same trap that we did.",1,"Has anyone heard of an ""UNDIAGNOSED pre-existing"" condition?",2,2022-09-21T00:00:00.000Z,2023-05-08T21:05:35.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/embracepetinsurance.com?page=80

I signed up online, purchased my policy, and my Embrace profile showed that my policy was active and I read that if my pup had any conditions, Embrace would get the medical records from my vet after I filed a claim online. Seemed easy enough. 

The following month, my puppy began urinating frequently. I took her into the vet, who said that my puppy hadn’t grown out of her loose puppy skin and it likely caused a UTI. When I filed a claim for medications, Embrace said that I hadn’t taken my puppy to the vet for an examination after purchasing their insurance, even though she had an examination just days prior, so they used that day’s examination as her initial examination. They determined that my puppy’s UTI was a pre-existing condition based on this technicality or, as I call it, one of their traps. Now if my puppy grows up and has any problems down there, although unrelated, it’s not going to be covered.

They would happily look at my puppy’s medical history if it benefited them, but they will exclude any previous evidence if they can. My puppy was just weeks old when she got her first exam!

64440787dc8235058464dce5,False,False,"For all of the problems I've had with this company, you'd think they'd stop sending me emails asking me to rate them. 

My 13 year old senior cat recently started showing signs of being ill so I ran her to the vet. Turns out she somehow ended up with an infection. 

I do my part on my end. She's listed with Embrace as a permanently healthy pet and I pay my premiums every month. I know I do because the only option to pay I have is for them to automatically take a payment off of a credit card and there is no way to change the payment date. So, all good on my end as the paying customer. 

I submitted the paperwork for her appointment that clear as day showed the date of her vet appointment was on Sunday, 4/16/2023. I submitted the paperwork to them the same day as the appointment, and the one thing they usually have done well is get the paperwork processed quickly. But up to Thursday I hadn't heard anything. So I called and asked, ""Is there a problem with the documents I submitted?"" and the girl said, ""No. I'm looking at it. Everything looks good. There should not be a problem with your claim."" 

This next morning I get an email from Embrace that Zeva's $237 infection claim was being denied because her vet appointment that took place *last* *Sunday* as of the day of this writing was more than 60 days ago. 

Again....

They were denying her claim because her vet appointment that took place *LAST* *SUNDAY* was somehow more than 60 days ago. 

Whomever processed her paperwork just didn't want to pay the claim. So they decided that her appointment that happened last Sunday actually happened on 4/16/*2021* and thus that's more than 60 days ago so they weren't going to pay it...and they were willing to risk that I was just going to take that.....that I was not going to stand up for my baby girl who is sitting at home with an infection. Why is this company offering pet insurance services if they don't want to help sick pets and their owners in emergencies like this? So I proceeded to light up someone over there and remind them that my insurance policy is a binding legal contract, so is the documentation that proves I was at the veterinarian’s office on 4/16/2023, not 4/16/2021 like they want it to be. The testimony from the people from the vets office backing me up that I was there on 4/16/2023 wouldn’t look great for them either. They do not get to alter reality to decide where I was and when so they would be wise to pay the claim. 

The guy looked at the documentation and was like, “Yea it clearly says 2023 on here."" I was then told it would take another 15 days for it to process, again. But I got an email in about an hour that the claim had been approved in full…but not for the full amount. I was only getting back about $56 because they were taking out $175 for her deductible.

So, with this my full deductible is paid for her now...on top of being a permanently healthy pet and receiving my premiums on time every month. But, let’s see what excuse they try to find to not cover a legitimate claim until I call raising hell next time.",1,For all of the problems I've had with…,0,2023-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,2023-04-22T18:12:55.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/embracepetinsurance.com?page=84

After over a year my dog started to get sick and her diagnosis was Cancer/Cushing's Disease. Embrace covered NOTHING for the numerous procedures we had to have done stating she had elevated liver levels prior to her diagnosis. My vet wrote an appeal letter and stated how those levels were barely over the limit and should not be held against us as they were not a cause for concern. They denied the claims again. I would not recommend Embrace to ANYONE. I paid almost $100 a month (I got more than the basic plan) for them to cover nothing and for me to cover all my dogs medical bills. The money I spend on their monthly services could have gone to her actual care instead.

The reasons for denying claims are extremely shaky -- their adjusters will look for any anomaly in the dog's medical history or bloodwork and use it as a blanket denial for all subsequent claims for the rest of the dog's life. Due to a single anomaly on a blood test when my dog was 7 years old (that resolved on her next bloodwork), Embrace denied all claims relating to her digestive system because a symptom of the bloodwork anomaly was ""nausea."" This included vomiting and illness after ingesting a candy bar, which required emergency care. I appealed multiple times and was rejected at every turn.

It may have taken several years, but I’ll never forget what Embrace did for me. They did not behave like an insurance company. Instead, they treated me as a stressed out pet owner who needed a little extra help and understanding. 

Embrace enabled me to afford a surgery for my 13-year-old dog that otherwise I couldn’t logically spend on him.

Also, my dog has a small mass on his chest his whole life which is roughly the size of a dime. This mass has remained the same size his whole life. Embrace rep, told me since we dont have exact explanation of the cause of the mass, my dog is no longer covered for any time of cancer.

Response to Embrace(3/24/2023)

I am posting this as a response to embraces comments since I cant respond directly. I just want to clarify that the response by Embrace is intended only to support their interests without any accurate information. I have purchased hygiene products from my vet for my dog's entire life. Whether it was ear cleaning liquid or toothpaste and because of this, they wont cover my dog. They handpick the facts which fit their interest and exclude the others. The dates referred by Embrace's response are hygiene product purchases because I couldn't buy the same products at my local Petco. It's normal upkeep and maintenance just like brushing their teeth and clipping nails. With Embrace's logic, if I continue to clean my dogs ears on a consistent basis then he's not covered, but if I stop and actually let them get infected, then he's covered. What kind of stupid nonsense is this? I am so glad they responded to my complaint because their response shows how fraudulent and incompetent they really are.",1,Very untrustworthy - they lie and deceive,0,2023-02-12T00:00:00.000Z,2023-03-18T20:20:51.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/embracepetinsurance.com?page=93

641132b28162b849ac31bc8c,False,False,"I picked Embrace out of the pile at the recommendation of the shelter I adopted my dogs from. I have filed a half dozen or so claims for my older dog. Thus far, every significant claim I have filed resulted in a protracted period where I awaited response (at times longer than the 15 business day turnaround advertised), only to be told (erroneously) that my claim was denied due to the issue being a preexisting condition (which has been an incorrect assertion every time). These have been with different adjusters, so it’s puzzling that I’m seeing a pattern where the rationale is either fundamentally incorrect or they’re misinterpreting my dogs history. 

To make matters worse I am a human physician, so when the rationale doesn’t make any sense it’s straight forward for me to point it out. Yet only a few times has the decision reversed after my input. Other times they demand an appeal letter from the veterinarian to reconsider the decision, which most recently involved denying a claim because a preexisting condition was listed as one of ten potential explanations for an acute illness. Appeal letter writing is a tactic used by human insurance companies in the hopes that the doctor won’t have time or the patient will give up, which would be the equivalent of getting a bluff through in a game of poker and is functionally practicing medicine without a license. It makes me wonder how many Embrace customers accept claim decisions in good faith simply because they don’t have medical training. 
Thus far my experience has been frustrating due to delays and nonsense arguments from adjusters. Insurance is meant to be “peace of mind” and to protect those one values. Embrace advertises the letter of that sentiment but is quite brutally missing the spirit.

(Fear that we might taking them back to the shelter) Sure enough, on subsequent visits, the heart murmur was no longer heard. In early January one of the cats started coughing. Usually just once a day, but just to be sure he was okay I took him to the vet. They did x-rays and gave him a shot for asthma. On the x-ray, they thought his heart looked a little enlarged so they recommended an echocardiogram. I knew this was an expensive test, but I thought, better safe than sorry and also felt at ease because I had Embrace pet insurance. Luckily the echo came back fine and the cough cleared up from the shot. What a relief! Well, until I found out the claim had been DENIED!!! After waiting over a month both claims were denied by Embrace because they declared him as having a pre-existing condition. Apparently, the heart murmur that no longer exists nullified the claims. My vet wrote a letter to Embrace assuring them that the heart murmur was ""white coat syndrome"" but they still denied the claim.

It is very easy to end up with pre existing conditions that will never be covered. Second, the waiting period needs to be followed. Be a good pet parent and get your animals tested for EVERYTHING. Especially your rescues. If you get in front of things and are willing to pay out of pocket at first, embrace is fantastic.

63e1660c745e4800219cc3cc,False,False,"Although it took a couple more days than advertised to repay me for my cat's wellness expenses, Embrace did follow through with repayment on that. I was mostly pleased with that.

However,  Embrace took far longer than they advertised to fulfill claims (around 14 business days to process a claim). It actually took more than 30 business days due to required medical history reviews that I thought Embrace would have already requested and completed around the beginning of my policy.

Last week I reached out to the Embrace claim team asking for an update on why it was taking so long to get past the 'pending medical history' stage on my claims. The lady told me that they had still not received the records from one of the vets. I don't know why I was not informed beforehand that they had still not received them, as quite some time had past by then, but I reached out to the vet that day and made sure that the records were sent. 

The claims lady confirmed that she got them and ensured that she would have the adjuster expedite my claims. She said that they should be done by Friday night, if not that evening. They were not done until today.

After having to wait for over a month to get a resolution, I've been told today that Embrace will not cover the expenses I paid for my cat's pleural effusion (fluid in the chest) because it is being considered as a pre-existing condition - the only thing they'll cover is the euthanasia and cremation. The reasoning I was given was that the emergency vet noted he had a heart murmur back in September, which was before I started the policy and the vet that I took him to last month was never able to determine the cause of my cat's fluid.

I am extremely displeased with Embrace. Not only was I made to wait twice as long as advertised to get my claims resolved (and they did not even reach out to me to let me know what was causing the delay), but Embrace decided to not cover a condition that did not have a determined cause just because a heart murmur was noted a few months ago. Per what I was told by the vet, the cause could have been at least 3 different things. There is no proof that the heart murmur is related to the fluid. 

Not only has Embrace not been helpful, but they've also made my financial situation even worse than if I had just handled the expenses on my own.

Be careful with this insurance charging thousands of dollars with your credit cards.They use preexisting condition to deny almost every claim.  You will be stuck paying this bill for years to come. We got sick of their misleadingly confusing reason to deny almost all claims that we canceled then a week after our dog got sick & bills closed to $8K so they dodged another claim to deny to pay. We tried to give it another chance thinking maybe some will get covered. In the almost 2 years I’ve been with this insurance they never paid any of my claims. We took our dog 2 months ago to the ER & submitted the claim $3k & took 2 months as usual it’s denied.

63ada7ce4d0773066a2859ee,False,False,"Worthless. No, worse than worthless. Actively malicious.

My beloved ESA (a cat) had mammary cancer prior to my purchase of my Embrace policy. After I purchased the policy, my cat developed salivary gland cancer that is terminal (it has metastasized to the lungs). Despite all evidence to the contrary, including a letter from my cat's oncologist, Embrace judged that my cat's salivary gland cancer was of mammary origin and therefore a preexisting condition, refusing to cover the literal thousands I have to spend per month on my cat's care. The mental gymnastics required to call an obviously novel condition preexisting are nothing short of unbelievable, and obviously motivated by greed. Embrace doesn't care about animals, only about money, and they are willing to ignore the truth to save money. I will be pursuing legal action. They are making an already nightmarish situation--having a terminally ill pet--exponentially worse. If I could give zero stars, I would.

6388274fb84cc27618fc942a,False,False,"I have had Embrace for a few years and have never had to submit a claim, the only thing they did was increase my rate each year under the guise of my pet getting older. They don’t cover what you really need such as a yearly visit, vaccines and routine bloodwork or a dental cleaning. Plus you have to buy into a seperate plan for that. 
As your dog ages the premium goes up too. 
I have cancelled my policy and will be saving the $180.00 per month they just raised it to without the ""extra""coverage"" for the routine care.
Also, be mindful of what states pet insurance covers because Embrace raised my rates and explained they did an inquiry of my state and said my premium needed to be adjusted  because of where I lived and at that time raised it from $75.00/mo to $125.00/mo and I just was informed three days ago it will now be $180.00/mo. 
I was trying to protect my dogs health, but that didn't work. 
Don't be fooled by all the great ratings because they are all the same. I should have listened to myself before spending all this money for insurance I thought would be useful.

63535bec8056669a30a7f562,False,False,"On 6/1 I completed the applications for two pets’ insurance.
I submitted my dog’s healthy medical visit documents and was awaiting to set my cats next vet appointment, however, I received an email from Embrace that indicated that both my pets were now fully insured. This confused me so I called Embrace again thinking perhaps I misunderstood the policy.  I called in to see if Embrace had all that was needed for my cat’s health insurance, I was affirmed  from the customer service agent that nothing more was needed, they had everything for my cat and he was fully insured. I  asked again whether they needed another healthy wellness check prior to affirming my cats insurance was good, however, I was affirmed 2 more times that Embrace had everything they needed. Then I emailed on 7/12 and asked if his insurance is active, because I wanted it in writing. “Thank you for reaching out regarding your policy. I did take a look at Anikin’s policy and it was purchased the same day as Koda’s policy… it is active. “

This was over three months ago. When my cat had a uti I took him to the vet 8/26 and then it wasn’t until AFTER I SUBMITTED THE CLAIM TO EMBRACE that Embrace contacted me 9/14, 9/19, to say that it is missing his heathy vet check. Now I am being denied my claim because they said they never received the healthy wellness check from my vet. I am beyond furious because I have been paying for the insurance for MONTHS. When I asked to be sent the phone call recording /chat recording I was told that the request was against compliance rules. I was also told that regardless what I was told on the phone, needing the health check is written in the 17 page manual, so that is what they refer to, regardless what their rep told me. I am furious. When I asked to speak to a supervisor I was told one would return my call within 48 hours. What a joke!

If I was a customer service representative or someone who worked for this agency, and a client was missing important paperwork for three months, I would be calling them.

6353141e276a7fd30bd71ff3,False,False,"I'm not a serial complainer and don’t post a lot of bad reviews, but Embrace deserves one. I originally chose Embrace because of their discount to USAA members and my rationale that, by affiliation, Embrace would be the same sort of top-notch and scrupulous insurance company that USAA is. I was mistaken and very disappointed. Embrace isn't a terrible company, but like many insurers, they will bend every word and phrase in the insurance agreement to their benefit in order to deny coverage, and they have provisions in their policy that are one-sided and irrational to the point of absurdity. Then they'll lay on the fake sympathy when they tell you how disappointed they are that they can't cover your claim. Here's an example.

First, the exact policy provision: ""If your Pet showed Clinical Signs of any Dermatological Condition prior to the end of the Waiting Period, your Pet must be free of any Dermatological Conditions for twelve (12) consecutive months before any Dermatological Conditions may be covered again.""

Next, here’s how that shook out in real life. Our dog had a sarcoma (cancerous growth) between her toes removed in January 2022, several weeks prior to signing up for pet insurance with Embrace, so we understood and agreed that was a pre-existing condition for which we would not expect coverage. In August 2022, my dog irritated that same paw on a walk when she stepped on something. We took her in to the vet, who suggested that we soak her paw in an Epsom salt bath for a week, which resolved the issue. Embrace denied coverage for that vet visit (~$100), claiming that because the veterinarian didn't specifically rule out a recurrence of sarcoma in her visit notes, that they couldn’t rule it out as a pre-existing condition. This is despite the fact that the recommended course of treatment (Epsom salt baths and no recommendation for a biopsy) was not consistent with a recurrence of sarcoma. At our request, the veterinarian amended her notes to specifically state the obvious - that it was a skin irritation of the foot and not a recurrence of carcinoma - which we forwarded to Embrace as an appeal a couple weeks ago. After digging for a couple days to find a new reason to deny the claim, this time around, they essentially said ""well, you got us on the sarcoma thing, but we're still denying coverage” because – and get this – she had folliculitis ON HER SCALP in September 2021, four months before taking out the policy and eleven months before the FOOT irritation. Yes, they denied the claim for a reason they didn't originally think of the first time they processed the claim, which shows how much work they'll put into finding reasons to deny a ~$100 claim. Imagine the time they’ll put into larger claims. Adding insult to injury, they wrote their denials with way-over-the-top patronizing fake sympathy, stating how ""unfortunately"" they could not provide coverage, and how sorry they were that they couldn't, as if they shared in my misfortune, and as if denying claims didn't positively affect their bottom line. “Unfortunately” and “I’m sorry” seem to be their favorite words, and they’ll likely appear in Embrace’s response to this review, along with a statement that it pains them when they can't provide coverage for a condition.

Don't be fooled like I was. If you're looking for a different kind of insurance company, look elsewhere.",2,"Get ready for a bunch of ""I'm sorry's"" and ""Unfortunately's""",0,2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z,2022-10-21T23:50:22.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/embracepetinsurance.com?page=121

63226b4e7f7a8621ee5bf22a,False,False,"Appalling! I have a one and half year old Newfoundland who needed chiropractic care. He had two treatments over two months and the vet advised to continue once a month for a while.  I submitted two claims which went against my deductible.  The third claim was denied as Embrace have a limit of 12 weeks of chiropractic care for the LIFETIME of the dog.  So not 12 treatments. Not 12 weeks of treatment - but a 12 weeks time period.  So I could have done a treatment every day for 12 weeks and claimed every day - but because he didn’t need that - I chose two treatments over 10 weeks.  My third treatment fell outside of the 12 weeks window so now he is not eligible for any chiropractic treatment for the REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE.   This is absolute insanity and just such a rip off!  Additionally it could potentially save embrace thousands of dollar if I choose later to do X-rays or MRI as the issues are not resolved.   Shame on you Embrace for ripping off your customers again!


UPDATE TO YOUR RESPONSE 

I just read your response dated 13 minutes ago.  This doesn’t tell me anything!  It’s also mid leading when you say per covered condition!   Condition is the problem as far as I’m concerned.   So assuming he has a different issue that needs chiropractic treatment - different from his first condition!   He is still NOT COVERED.  Your policy is misleading as it should clearly state you only cover treatment for 12 consecutive weeks for the  LIFETIME OF THE DOG!!!   So if he hurts himself four years later and needs chiropractic care HE IS NOT COVERED!   Additionally your “ sales “ team does not understand this either.  I called to ask for a new policy.  I specifically asked about the 12 weeks and was told “no you can claim as often as you like”.  This is how you reel us us in - by lying!

Of course, my claim was denied so I am a little bitter but even it my claim was approved, the rate at which this claim took to process and the constant repeat of stock answers which half the time weren’t relevant to my claim at all each time I called has sent me on a shopping spree for another insurance. It would have been much easier to get denied a week in instead of strung along for weeks. Very condescending staff, with that typical “well just look where you signed here accepting X and X” crap you expect from an insurance company. 

I can’t wait to read the stock answer response that all the other negative reviews garnered. 🙄

Edit - And there’s the stock answer. So when they tell you that they needed to review the records and SOAP notes, that is of course true. What insurance company wouldn’t. That said, when they change the status of your claim to say that happened and they CC the pet owner to every email sent to the care provider, color me a little surprised that the *day of the denial of benefits* is the day the CCd email occurs. I have the emails with the timestamp, Embrace, so say whatever feel good spinned message you’d like. I can’t forge your own emails to make my story the real one.

630911097f7a8621ee4a8a2e,False,False,"Update (In response to Embrace's response): How is ""vomiting"" and ""diarrhea"" a pre-existing condition? Imagine if when you tried to get the health insurance they said ""we see here that you've had ankle pain in the past and you've also vomited and had diarrhea. So anything related to your ankle or that involves vomiting or diarrhea is not covered."" That doesn't make sense to anyone but pet insurance companies. Vomiting and diarrhea are symptoms, not conditions. Also, thank you for condescendingly pointing out that all of the information about pre-existing conditions was sent out in the terms and conditions. My point was that you never told me those cases applied to ME! You never said, we found these pre-existing conditions in your dog, just you know those won't be covered for a year. Unbelievable. Their response should tell you everything you need to know about the company. They are fraudulent, do not care or understand dogs or the difference between symptoms and conditions, and they will leave you stranded when you need them most. 

After a little over a year of solid service from Embrace, I had the dreaded negative experience, everyone, with pet insurance fears when filing a claim. I submitted a claim for one of my dogs who was vomiting and having diarrhea. Easy day, I thought. Just as I was starting to realize that the claim was taking longer than it had in the past, I get CC'd in an email from Embrace to my vet asking for my dog's medical history over the last year. Confused about why that would influence the status of my claim, I call Embrace who then proceeds to tell me that my dog has ""pre-existing conditions"" on my policy. I ask the Embrace representative which policy document would have those pre-existing conditions listed to which she responded that I don't have access to the document that lists them and that I could online get them sent to me if I had known to ask for it. Complete scam. I had been trying to make myself feel better about paying more for Embrace than every other competitor because I thought when I needed them, they would be there. Turns out they are just as conniving and dishonest as some of the others seem to be.

63005b30142fce1f45ff567f,False,False,"I went with Embrace for insurance and regret it. In the process of processing my first claim (my dog got a tick-borne illness and vestibular symptoms), Embrace reviewed my dog's history. During that review, Embrace focused on the fact that a year ago I asked the vet about a small bump on my dog's leg. At that time, the vet examined and tested the bump (needle aspirate) and said it was benign. Embrace, however, found this in the record and has declared that my dog has a pre-existing condition and will now not be covered for any future masses or any type of cancer. All this because of a benign cyst in his medical history! When I protested they said the only way to get back my dog's coverage for cancer would be to biopsy the bump to determine cytology--a procedure my dog *does not need*--no vet would say this is medically indicated. And if I don't do that, Embrace will deny him coverage if he ever gets cancer in the future. I'm a longtime USAA member and have always respected and appreciated USAA, so I'm really dismayed that Embrace is doing this sort of thing under USAA's name. At this point I'd like to change insurance plans, but now I'm stuck: Embrace has created a barrier to future coverage for a huge category of illnesses for my pet, and the only way I can get rid of it is through an unnecessary procedure and expensive lab work (lab work Embrace won't cover, despite the fact that they're requiring it). But if I switch insurance companies now, any future recurrence of the vestibular / tick borne illness will be considered a pre-existing condition by the new company. So I'm stuck.

I have paid $600 in premiums to cover $2300 in out of pocket medical expenses, and Embrace is covering ZERO.  Their pre-existing condition policy is outrageous (as commented by many other reviewers).  An example:  My dog had to have 2 teeth pulled and her teeth cleaned.  Because a previous visit identified plaque (the reason for the teeth cleaning), the company denied the claim because plaque was a ""pre-existing condition"". 
Imagine if you went to the dentist for a cleaning and they said because you had plaque we are considering any of your treatments a pre-existing condition and denying coverage.  Thats why you go to the dentist!  Additionally my dog has a skin allergy, so they denied any skin related charges due to pre-existing conditions.  And when my dog got an ear infection they denied that because of her skin allergy.  Because now ears and skin are the same thing?!? ADDITIONALLY they have another category called ""Wellness Rewards"" which unless you have added it to your policy they will not cover preventative care.  In short they designed another way to deny your claim.  This is a SCAM.  This industry needs to be regulated. DO NOT USE.

62db09574c35e69ec51719c0,False,False,"I too have come here to warn the public that Embrace.com and American Modern Home Insurance Company are an internet pet insurance scam. I enrolled in two plans for my cat Titus Maxwell Lewis I on 11/16/2021. One plan for wellness visits the other for major medical. $80.47 per month which is pretty steep as Titus was then only 9 months old (DOB 02.14.19) at this point. Initially, I had Trupanion insurance (referred by my vet), but they do not have a wellness plan. After spending hours of internet research (but not enough. I never looked at reviews) I was drawn in by Embrace because of their (non-existent) well care reimbursement (neuter and such) $650 annually. 
My Cat Titus was cleared for heart murmur and general heath twice by my vet. The reason I paid such attention to this is that my previous cat died at 4 yos due to CHF. Titus was found to have no signs of any issues prior to his neuter (I paid hundreds of extra dollars to specifically ensure that he was healthy this includes an echocardiogram). He was cleared for surgery on 4.27/22. On 5/11/22 we noticed a sudden cough and ran him to the vet. To our dismay he was diagnosed with CHF. The vet confirmed again that he had no issues prior to surgery and that the surgery caused no issues. CHF is congenital. 
We are again heartbroken. We have compiled thousands in medical bills, but we are covered now, right? My Embrace plans annual maximum is SUPOSSEDLY $10K. I can give Titus the treatment and extend his life without worry right? Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! I submitted all the bills we amassed to Embrace including the Neutering under the wellness plan. They have dragged their feet for over 30 days and have now come back and DENIED all claims citing pre-existing conditions – which we were cleared of by them in Dec. 2021. They will pay nothing apparently and underwriter whose entire job is to send vacuous expressions of empathy, deny valid insurance claims making no effort to explain why “any pre-existing conditions” were not called out when Embrace received Titus’s medical history back in November 2021. They cannot explain why Embrace continued to take a year’s worth of insurance premiums without such notification. I did receive $540 of my $650 for wellness finally someone followed up. I missed it as I'm looking for more $$$. They are happy to cancel my nonexistent coverage now that they have my $643.00. Amid all of this they notified me that my July premium was due, and they could not deduct it.


HA!


Before selecting this company, I pursued Nationwide. It is unfortunate that I was drawn into Embrace by their Wellness plan and DID not do my homework. However, I am glad I did not sign my Pug here. Embrace is an insurance internet fraud they now have $643 in premiums from me and will cover nothing.

We are saddened that it was such a frustrating journey to achieve these results. And, we are now very aware of the huge limitations and loopholes of pet insurance.  


The reason I decided to try pet insurance for the first time was because USAA was partnering with Embrace.  I thought I could trust a company that USAA put its faith in.   Embrace has not live up to USAA's standards of taking caring of customers so far.  At a time when I need something to be easy and supportive, the emotional toll of dealing with jumping through hoops for insurance claims to be denied over and over is not worth it. 

Embrace has denied all claims on ridiculous exclusions on our dog who has been incredibly healthy until a recent ER visit.  How lymph node issues, lethargy and no appetite can be denied because over a year ago we had a fatty mass checked out by the vet but not aspirated is beyond me.

They have permanently excluded almost every possible condition for our dog now.

Please be aware that if you find a mass on your dog (even just a fatty tissue one) and you do not needle aspirate it, Embrace will deny all claims going forward for ANY new masses (and other health issues as well).

I was better off just paying out of pocket for medical expenses as opposed to paying high monthly fees for an insurance policy that I could not even use. I was paying into my policy for about a year and then all of a sudden my monthly fees go up 55% out of nowhere. Embrace pet insurance claimed that my cat had a pre-existing condition. This is not true because my cat was not diagnosed with this condition until after I started my policy with embrace. Embrace would not pay for any claims that I submitted. So basically I was paying into a policy that I could not even use and my cat was only dealing with that one condition only. Embrace pet insurance is a total waste of time and I would never recommend this company to anyone on earth or any other planet for that matter. Embrace pet insurance would not accept any of my claims yet they can abruptly raise my monthly fees by 55% without a warning. I am totally disgusted with this company and I will never join this company nor recommend this company to anyone ever again in life. If I could give this insurance company zero stars, then I definitely would have. Also the fact that I have to put out medical expenses first in hopes that I get reimbursed by the insurance company is also bogus. Is there any pet insurance company out there where you don't have to come out of pocket UP FRONT and you can just use the insurance card and it will cover most if not all of the bill???

62ba56d7ba5bb6ef0425095d,False,False,"I purchased Embrace policies for my two cats, one of whom had eye damage from an infection as a baby, before I adopted her. I was of course aware of this condition and understood that any complications related to the previous eye damage wouldn't be covered by Embrace.

Then my cats got into a fight, and my kitten sustained a new, unrelated eye injury. She had to have an eye removed, and then had a post-surgical infection. Throughout the stressful and expensive procedures, I took comfort in the knowledge that her bills would be covered by Embrace... until Embrace rejected all my claims.

Their argument is that this injury counts as a pre-existing condition, because my kitten's previous eye damage increased the RISK of complication in the case of another unrelated injury. This is based of their own assessments, not the opinion of the vet who actually saw my pet. But even more concerning is that this criteria does NOT appear in the policy.

In Embrace's own Policy Terms & Conditions, a pre-existing condition is defined:

""Pre-existing Condition(s) means:
   a. A Chronic Condition observed by you or your Veterinary Provider prior to the end of the Waiting Period for your Pet(s) and any related conditions; or
   b. An Illness or Injury that first occurred or showed Clinical Signs prior to the end of the Waiting Period for
your Pet and any related conditions.
   c. Undiagnosed conditions with the same Clinical Signs as those in a. or b. above are also considered preexisting.""

This definition does NOT extend to any future, unrelated, new injuries where a pre-existing condition could have elevated risk factor or made a pet pre-disposed to future complications. It's simply not in the policy.

I have attempted to get clarity from Embrace representatives about what criteria they used in their denial of my claims, what future claims might be denied on these grounds, or to point me to where the policy mentions complication risk factor as determining a preexisting condition. The adjuster I spoke to, Taylor, insisted that she is unable to answer any of my questions.

I'm in the process of filing a second appeal, which will involve getting ahold of the ER doctor who saw my cat, since a letter from my regular vet who knows my pet best was not sufficient for Embrace.",1,This company doesn't follow their own terms & conditions.,1,,2022-06-28T03:18:15.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/embracepetinsurance.com?page=132

To the point of using insignificant findings from routine tests. Furthermore they exercise the right to arbitrarily assign new pre-existing conditions. My cat tested positive for FIV  when we went to reup his vaccines. Embrace used every single note of anything that could possibly be construed as autoimmune to indicate that he had FIV before the coverage period despite my vet pointing out that none of these ""symptoms"" are recognized clinical signs of FIV. in fact his load is too low to indicate a chronic infection. Embraces response was to tell my vet that she was wrong and assigned FIV as a pre-existing condition. They now reject almost every single medical claim from dental work to ear infections because ""he has FIV"".

62aa673c266eedb3c15a86d9,False,False,"Excellent insurance with an easy to use app.  We chose Wellness (the max amount) and Accident/Illness with a $200 deductible for our 6mo old puppy. Thankfully he's healthy and had no issues prior to obtaining insurance.  Both parts of the insurance have already proven to be invaluable.  We used the Wellness for our pups neutering, grooming, training, anal expressing, vaccines, ticks/flea treatments, etc.  We still have money left for use on our wellness plan and have until April of next year to do so.  Recently he began vomitting and had diarrhea.  The bill was $245.  I didn't want to also pay a $200 deductibl so i didnt file a claim.  Well a few wks later it happened again.  This bill was $200.  I decided to submit both claims and just pay the deductible.  Turns out that they just took the deductible from the 1st claim and I was reimbursed $45!  So for the 2nd claim I will be reimbursed in full!!  And no more deductible to worry about until we renew next year!  It's horrible if your furbaby becomes ill.  To not be able to get the medical help needed could be devastating.  So thankful for Embrace Insurance.  Our claims have all been reimbursed within 1 week.  Just make sure to get a copy of your vet's notes as well as the invoice for accident/illness claims.

My dog had NEVER been diagnosed or even suggested by a vet that she had this prior to this. After 45 days of waiting I received an email from the adjuster saying my dog would not be covered for Cushing's because she had symptoms prior to the waiting period.  I purchased the policy a the end of Feb 2022. Waiting period was over by first week of March 2022. They combed through all of my dog's medical history looking for a way to link something to her current diagnosis. The adjuster referred lab work from April 2021 where my dog's liver enzymes were SLIGHTLY elevated and said 'We cannot rule out that this is related to Cushing's Disease'. Let me repeat that no vet EVER said to me that this elevated lab value could be related to Cushing's Disease. As a matter of fact the Vet was treating my dog from a recent gall bladder removal surgery which can affect liver values.  This company is a rip off. They will try to find any lab value that can support their claim to deny your claim.  Don't buy insurance from them unless your dog has NO LAB WORK on file ANYWHERE or you have a puppy.

My 4.5 year old dog is completely healthy and had only seen mobile vet clinics for vaccinations and flea/tick prevention meds up until last month. When I started my policy in September I was under the impression that there was a waiting period for coverage to start if no act was taken on my part, and if I wanted immediate coverage I needed to go in for a checkup to verify there were no pre-existing conditions within a 2 week period. Since I am a busy emergency room nurse during a pandemic, and since my mobile vet clinic kept rescheduling due to covid, I ended up opting for the waiting period. 
So imagine my surprise when over 6 months into paying for insurance, and well after the waiting period has ended, my dog gets a tick bite and embrace tells me that it may not be covered because they didn’t have a well visit sent in the first 2 weeks of coverage. AS IF A CURRENT TICK BITE IS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION!!
The tick head was literally still in her body. 

I called customer service last week (be prepared for a 45 minute wait on hold), and I re-sent the doctor’s notes to the agent I spoke with. I still see the claim status as “on hold” pending documents today.

62785b20f03a9893e9879e14,False,False,"I left a high review after my experience of easily submitting a claim. What I did not count on, was how IMPOSSIBLE it would be to get my claim processed. In spite of completely submitting not only visit notes, but including an unremarkable medical history, because my puppy has never had anything other than healthy pet and vaccines, my claim was put on hold for not having medical history. Nothing I could do would change this.  I could not include a history to show any prior conditions because there was none.

Out of frustration, I cancelled our policy and would give 0 stars if I could.

As for the reply. I can add that these people are also illiterate.  There WAS NO pre-existing condition.  This was a puppy that had been insured with EMBRACE for 7 months.  Frankie is now a healthy 11-month-old Brittany.  She was treated for ENTERITIS -- a condition you get when you eat something bad and get diarrhea!  

No one wanted to look at the vet notes, I guess.  Each visit was listed by date as ""Healthy Pet"" and a corresponding date for puppy vaccinations.  We have additional dates for weigh-ins because I monitor her growth.

This is a case of willful denial.  How can you provide information about a pre-existing condition if none existed, and the condition treated isn't predicated by one?

Again, these people suck.  I have a conformation dog and I want you people to know that I am spreading the word in my world to avoid your comany.  Your idiotic response and lack of effort to even try to remedy the situation just proves I am right.

People, don't waste your money with this coverage. It's not insurance, it is bait and switch, false advertising, a sham.

And if you want to resolve it as indicated below, pay the claim.  I don't have an hour to wait on hold. I gave up on that already.  I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.

They are the epitome of what insurance companies' true intents are. They want to take your money and when it's time for them to pay up they will try to find every loophole in the book not too. I went with embrace because they are partnered with USAA. NOT THE SAME SERVICE!
Embraces policy states that your pet will need to have had a medical evaluation at least 12 months prior to or two weeks after activation of service. If this does not happen then any accidents will have a two-day waiting period, illnesses will have a 14-day waiting period and orthopedic issues will have a six-month waiting period. But their policy also states that if the evaluation does not happen your coverage will revert to accident only. Very confusing... on purpose I am sure.
My pet insurance was activated on the 15th of March. 
On April the 4th my dog was attacked by two strays who were walking the streets unleashed. After taking my dog to the emergency room. I filed my claim with embrace and they stated that they were not able to get a hold of my veterinarian so they needed me to send his medical records so that I may be reimbursed. When I sent them the records they refused to reimburse me because my vet had not completed a medical evaluation due to his aggression. Of course, I did not know this but it should not matter the two-day waiting period had passed!. He was seen by my vet, I thought I was good. My dog being attacked is not a pre-existing condition so I do not know what the problem is?
My dog is a very loving dog he just does not like to go to the vet and admittedly so needs to be muzzled to go. Now Embrace is sending me emails about how since he is labeled as aggressive they will not cover him at all!

There were things under preexisting that the vet has never said are a problem!

You still talk too long. 
I had one of the reps email me and say, “I read in the notes you told Banfield you didn’t want a wellness plan bc you had one already” and then asks me who it is!?!? Excuse me did you even look at my coverages to see I had wellness through you guys. Geeez maybe that’s why I didn’t want one through Banfield. Now I’m thinking I should had it through them instead. Absolutely horrible.


Reply to their reply:

First of all, all the emails you sent me where asking for mor medical records. I advised you multiple times, hey she’s a puppy. I gave you her records that the breeder gave me and you kept asking for more records. Your emails kept asking for a years worth! Lol this is almost comical. She was an 8 week old puppy. Seriously? I kept emailing you guys telling you this and I would get the same automated response. 
Don’t get me started on my other dog I have a claim open since April 2021 that’s supposed to be A WELLNESS VIST! He got his shots!!!!! They gave him anxiety medication because he was scared of them. 
Yet you send me the automated responses need 12 months of records. 
I have contacted his vet and they sent you everything, not sure what I need for a WELLNESS VIST.

So basically, if I put off my dog's surgery until 1 minute past midnight, I could have gotten the surgery covered (at least that's what they claim). They told me there was nothing they could do, no options or suggestions were offered to me, they offered to cover NOTHING. I understand the 6-month waiting period policy not covering the surgery itself but I was surprised that I was told I couldn't get coverage for a single thing outside of that surgery either (medications, blood work, hospital stay fees, nothing). I paid in for 6 months and couldn't utilize anything from the insurance because of a couple hours between my dog's surgery and the end of my 6-month waiting period.

Since he was transported from down South with a van full of dogs, he developed kennel cough that needed to be treated shortly after he arrived. He fully recovered from that with antibiotics. That was the start of our issues with Embrace.

He developed another cough, with no close contact with other dogs, several months later. This was determined to be a ""pre-existing condition"", apparently simply because it was respiratory, and even though the earlier cough had completely cleared up and he had been healthy for months.

Our most recent interaction with Embrace was the topper. He was diagnosed with heartworm, and you guessed it, the claim was rejected as a pre-existing condition, even though I see no connection between respiratory infections that have been cured and newly-diagnosed heartworm, and neither does our vet.

Apparently, everything is now a pre-existing condition in Embrace's eyes. I don't see what the point is in pet insurance if nothing, even things that are seemingly unrelated, aren't covered.

Coverage of medication cost is good. I use embrace for all my pets and will continue to do so.

Unfortunately there is no coverage for anything preventative, they have a wellness rewards program that is a literal money pit so I have never used it.
( explanation below )

You put money into it the rewards program ($450 or $650 per year) and then when you take your pet for grooming/training/preventative care treatments you pay completely out of pocket. Then you submit a wellness rewards claim and they reimburse you. If you purchased the $650 option and you only spend $200 does the money roll over? do they give it back? NO, they keep it, you didn't use it so you lost it, it's theirs now.

Summary: Wellness Rewards program is a ""budgeting tool"", where you lose all money you put in that you didn't use and where you put twice the strain on your wallet. (1st money into the wellness rewards, 2nd money at treatment purchase)

Ruling:
Get the insurance with Embrace, get RX reimbursement with Embrace, they are really good.

619311824e475d8cc62eb18f,False,False,"I gave one star as it doesn’t allow “0”.

I did my share of checking and Embrace initially appeared to be a decent above board company that offered multiple options on policies.

What a friggin joke! I purchased a policy for my dog in July 2020. I was well aware of waiting periods for sickness and orthopedic care, or having an exam to essentially “clear” them for coverage.

In August 2021, THIRTEEN months after purchasing my dog suffered a broken leg. Now I’m being told she isn’t covered because I didn’t have a screening exam, with one agent telling me “maybe”, as if it could be, a pre-existing condition. WT actual F? A severe spiral fracture pre-existing? As if I’d wait more than a year for treatment.

After much back and forth and a truckload of condescending BS the Embrace rep I spoke to, with apparent support from management, are denying  benefits because she wasn’t pre-screened over a year ago for orthopedics for an accidental broken leg now. I understand the 6 month waiting period for ortho care when you sign up.

I was informed that the waiting period is extended if no exam occurs. So I’ve been paying on a policy now for 16 months and it still wouldn’t be provide ben fits, with ortho waiting period beginning again because she’s had a broken leg. How’s that for circular logic?

The recent rep told me that I was sent emails explaining these conditions. Really? An email? Not one that identified my specific issues but the general ones describing their policy. I have never seen them but that’s not a surprise. I don’t scan my “spam” folder for messages. I also had a few other things to focus on. Deployments tend to keep you occupied.

They “graciously” (heavy sarcasm here” offered to refund my payments to this point and allow me to start over. As if there were any way in HELL I would use, recommend or even consider their company at this point.

This is the second dog in less than a year they have denied benefits. The other one died. I won’t even bother describing why they denied the claim. Let’s just say it as equally ludicrous.

I went with Embrace initially as among other things it was sponsored by USAA. I will most definitely let them know the company has NO issue screwing over veterans.

Save yourself time, money, stress and your pets welfare. Find a company that actually honors their policy.

In addition to this review I plan to do the same on Google, FB, the Better Business Bureau, NCPB and any other site I can find to forewarn others.

I’m not into anonymity when reviewing. I WANT them to know who wrote this review.

61788f29234f1b1fe565ce8f,False,False,"My dogs are currently 12. I got Embrace policies for them as puppies, because I wanted them to have coverage when they were older. Embrace did allow me to see any vet and did pay the claims. If you are looking for pet insurance for a puppy, hoping it will carry protection when they are older, Embrace raised the cost of the policies such that it would cost $1,000+ more year to have pet insurance, on a max claim, than to not. I didn't catch this earlier, the higher premiums started when they were 9-10 but I didn't pause to do the math. I regret not going with a different pet insurance company from the start and want to warn others who are shopping for insurance for puppies. They told me it is not based on health conditions or claims- simply the age of the dog, breed of dog, and zip code. My recommendation shopping for pet insurance for a puppy is don't make my mistake- shop based on quotes for an older dog. There are other companies that offer reasonable plans for older dogs that, if I had gone with from the get go, I wouldn't have any concern of pre-existing conditions. Also, when Embrace offered the option of increasing the limits on the policy so that the high amount I was paying would make more sense (with a higher annual limit), pre-existing conditions would then be an issue. A customer service agent told me repeatedly that because my 12 year old dog had diarrhea as a puppy, which was cured with antibiotics, any disorder that could potentially have a symptom of diarrhea would not be covered- be wary of their interpretation/response to pre-existing conditions.

60b24c78f9f4870b7011e223,False,False,"My puppy got pneumonia within a couple days of the end of the waiting period for pre-existing conditions. Based on that, after months of not approving any claims, the finalized a review of my puppy’s medical history and responded with the broadest possible interpretation of what would be excluded based on his illness as a puppy. 

The claims adjuster said that they would not actually enforce the limitations as broadly as the exclusions are written because they “try to cover” as many claims as they can. Clearly, that’s not the case if they even have pre-existing conditions exclusions to begin with. More importantly, I basically have no idea at this point what my policy  covers. They can’t explain what is covered so I know if I can bring my puppy to the vet and have coverage for him. And, if I bring him in for anything that falls under those absurdly broad exceptions and they decide not to cover it, the clock resets on his exclusions. Basically, at this point, I have no confidence that I can afford my pet’s care and I can’t change my insurance because, since they took so long to come back with their terrible and overly broad interpretation of exclusions, there would now be additional exclusions for pre-existing conditions if I went with a competitor. 

If, as your representatives say, you try to cover as much as you can for your members, then just do that and provide them the confidence that their pets will receive the care they deserve. Excluding pneumonia makes sense. Excluding every possible symptom that could be related to any respiratory infection is a way to minimize coverage, maximize profits, put pets at risk, and increase the financial burden put on pet owners.

The company’s response below perfectly illustrates the problem. They’re writing these exclusions so that they can deny coverage on anything related to diarrhea, vomiting, coughing, eye discharge, or any upper respiratory infection for 1 year whether or not those symptoms are related to what my puppy was actually sick from during the incident in question. He could get any of those symptoms from a WIDE variety of illnesses. If he gets any of those symptoms and I take him to a vet, not only do I likely bear the full cost, Embrace gets to reset the clock on these “short term” exclusions. Representatives from the company would say they would never do such a thing and would only refuse coverage if...something, something...that they can’t explain. Why should I believe you? Also if, as you said in your reply, you just “have to comply” with all the fine print you hope your customers don’t notice when they sign up for a policy, then please don’t say that you try to cover everything. You don’t. And you haven’t provided any clarity on what is covered. In reality, your organization has made choice to exclude coverage in the broadest terms possible. Don’t hide behind “have to” when these situations are a result of conscious organizational choices to enhance company profitability at the expense of your customers and their pets.",1,Unreasonably broad and unclear exclusions,3,,2021-05-29T14:15:20.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/embracepetinsurance.com?page=155
60b022dff9f4870a94af3a32,False,False,"My puppy was seen by a canine dentist for a misaligned canine tooth 2-1/2 months ago. I submitted a claim, which has not been credited toward our deductible. A follow up for a second opinion with a better qualified vet 2 months ago also still on hold. In the mean time, in lieu of surgery, using an inexpensive device and with the approval of the second dentist, I was able to encourage his canine tooth into the correct position, saving us and Embrace money. 

I have given Embrace every single thing they've asked for as far as medical records are concerned. I have provided information for the out of state vet that did his well puppy check where he was deemed healthy with no medical issues. Had he come from a shelter or ""rescue"", instead of a responsible breeder, he would have no medical records to check, so I guess Embrace is penalizing me for owning a well bred dog from a responsible breeder.

I received yet another email stating that the claim is on hold for want of medical records, that I know have already been provided to Embrace. Because we have a high deductible Embrace isn't even paying any money on this claim, merely crediting a portion of the bill toward our annual deductible. Embrace seems to be making no effort to resolve this claim without me calling them every few weeks to inquire why it hasn't yet been resolved.

Embrace used to be a wonderful company. They've obviously changed.

Edited to add: I have already provided ALL of my puppy's medical records to Embrace. Their request that I do so again, is just another example of their continued foot dragging. No employee that I have talked to has been happy to research anything to get this claim credited. It's all on me, as an owner, to call Embrace repeatedly and hope I get an employee willing to actually address this specific issue. When Embrace got records that did not answer their questions, they did nothing except send me yet another non-specific email refusing to credit my claim toward my puppy's deductible.

Edited to add: Just received yet another foot dragging email from Embrace that concluded with the following. ""This process can take up to 30 business days once we've collected all necessary medical records, and it is likely you will not receive any updates during this time."" and ""Feel free to contact us if our requested time frame has been exceeded.""

I paid out of pocket to be reimbursed later. I pay over 65 dollars a month. I have had them 8 months. So about 520 dollars is what I’ve paid them so far. I filed my claim, which took forever , it was way more than the two business days that was stated to me because I was a USAA member.  Moving on, once my claim way filed, out of the 600 something odd dollars, they took 500 something for the deductible. So it’s left me with 70 something odd dollars for my 600 plus vet bill. Apparently this is something you must pay every year, then and only then you’re only eligible for up 80 percent reimbursement. If you ask me, you’re better off putting aside 150 a month for your pets, that way when you need the money there is no wait. Makes no difference since you’re paying out of pocket to begin with. Just another thing you pay tons of money into for what? Maybe your healthy pet needs some surgery or something? Most dogs never have issues till they are older anyways. If you feed your beloved best friend the best and love them. Most times that’s enough till later on in their life. So if you set aside 150 a month, that’s 1800 a year, so I’m going off of my dogs, the oldest which is 8, I would have saved over 12,600 for vet emergencies etc. trust me when I tell you, this is way better than eating a 600 dollar vet bill because of a deductible. Do the smart thing and start saving now. That way there is no maybe, that you’ll get reimbursed. You will have the money and not worry about dealing with a damn claims department and wasting 68 plus dollars a month on some crap. When you get a pet, start saving as much as you can every month.

Now, we have a new puppy and she gets into everything.  We had an unfortunate incident and she ended up at Emergency Veterinary Services, with a costly emergency surgery. Since we had all our examinations/checks done before this incident, we had everything covered, and it truly is a savior.  A few thousand dollar bill became manageable since the policy kicked in.

This is all very emotional, scary and expensive. As the medical bills were mounting, I finally got to the point where I needed to take the time to gather the paperwork (which I already had, but needed to scan) and submit the claims. To my pleasant surprise, the claims process requires no claims forms to be completed by me or the various veterinarians; all I needed to do was upload the detailed receipts and provide an explanation, as well as upload any supporting documentation I had. This could not have been easier! By checking the status of the claims online I could tell that the claims reps had started to work on them, as well as the status of each. There were 18 claims that I initially submitted. If there was any additional information needed from the vets, the claims reps requested what was needed. Some claims were processed and paid within 2 days, and all were processed and paid in just under one week!!! This far surpassed any expectations I had. Because I pay all bills in full, It was nice to be able to replenish the savings account that had taken quite a hit in a relatively short period of time. Unfortunately there will continue to be medical bills for both dogs. Hopefully the issues with one dog may not be as bad as originally diagnosed, but one dog has a couple of different cancers and is going through treatment, which will be ongoing for a while, so fingers crossed he does as well as another dog of ours who had cancer many years ago and lived 6 years after diagnosis and treatment (to nearly 18!!!).

It has always been my opinion that the function of insurance companies is to avoid any payouts.  Embrace has proved me wrong.

The only complaint I have about this company is the time it takes to get reimbursed.  Our first claim was early in the pandemic, and it took a very long time to get results.  The second claim was more recently, and the timing was better.

If I understand correctly, once I file a claim Embrace has a defined amount of time to process and pay or deny.  In our cases that's not exactly what happened.  I was told several times that they have 14 days to process a claim.  

As it turned out our claims were paid 14 days after they contacted our vet and processed the paperwork.  But the problem was, the vet was not contacted for several weeks.  Once the vet responded, Embrace started processing. So 14 days from claim-to-result was not quite correct and a bit deceptive.

I was able to breathe a huge sigh of relief that the tough decisions we might have to make about our girl wouldn't be influenced by lack of money because our Embrace insurance was going to help us take care of her.
Our girl is on the mend, though we still have a long road ahead of us, but Embrace has processed our claims in a timely manner to help us manage the financial burden of her care. I have nothing but praise for the customer service and quick turn-around time for claims processing!

This company is the most vile, untrustworthy, horrific, outrageously sinister organization I have yet to deal with.  Please people, do not buy from this bottom dweller company.  Here is the letter they sent me months after I had already fired them. Clearly they have no desire to cover anything yet they wanted to continue collecting my money.  Run people run!

Hello Robert,
While gathering medical history or chatting with you, one of our Embracers indicated it would be a good idea to a medical history review for Lucy. A medical history review is an email with an outline of any possible pre-existing conditions based on Lucy's medical history. It is just a way for us to communicate any coverage exclusions so you are not caught by surprise. We want you to have a full, clear understanding of your policy and any possible exclusions.
This medical history review tells you what is and is not covered based on any clinical signs and diagnoses noted in Lucy's medical history we have in hand over the last 12 months.
The following pre-existing chronic conditions shown in Lucy's vet records are excluded permanently:
1. Joint crepitation (of the stifles [knees], bilaterally); and any underlying/related conditions and/or clinical signs; including but not limited to osteoarthritis.
2. Tartar accumulation; as this abnormality was noted prior to your policy start, the condition is pre-existing and is therefore ineligible for coverage under your $1,000 dental illness sublimit. Reimbursement for this issue is available to you under our optional Wellness Rewards Plan. Wellness Rewards does not exclude pre-existing dental illnesses. Once Lucy has a dental cleaning performed, this pre-existing condition will expire, and future dental illness claims will be covered under your dental illness sublimit.   
3. Cranial cruciate ligament tear (CCL/ACL), bilaterally; and any related conditions and/or clinical signs. Osteoarthritis (of the knees), bilaterally; this is excluded as it is at a greater risk of developing due to the cruciate ligament tear.
4.  Adverse drug reaction to Nexgard; including but not limited to conditions caused by or related to the drug reaction.                   
5. Skin mass; the vet notes indicate that on 3/22/2019, Lucy had a mass on her back. I do not see that any diagnostics were performed (i.e. biopsy or fine needle aspirate) in order to determine the composition of this mass. As such, this and any future masses (including cancer) would be excluded from coverage by the policy. Having diagnostics performed on this mass (so that it can be determined what type of mass it is) will allow us to narrow the coverage exclusion down to only that type. If there were indeed lab tests done at the time, and those results just were not sent to us, please have them sent over so we can see the result records and modify the exclusion accordingly.
The following curable (temporary) conditions are excluded until Lucy has been free of them or any treatment of them for 12 months:
1. Vomiting; and any related/underlying condition. This exclusion may be eligible for expiration on 12/9/2020, provided Lucy remains free from symptoms and/or treatment for 12 months.
2. Abnormal lab value (elevated alkaline phosphatase, a liver value); this was listed as abnormal on lab work performed on 12/27/2019. Any condition related to this abnormality would not be covered by the policy unless we can clearly determine they are unrelated. This exclusion may expire on 4/30/2021 provided Lucy remains free of clinical signs and/or treatment for this for 12 consecutive months.

They denied my cat coverage based on some inaccurate notes by a vet who did not receive any information from me directly.
My cat was examined by a shelter vet at adoption and had  had an upper respiratory bacterial infection treated with anti biotics. He was given the all clear. Two other vets have examined my cat  since and found him to be in good health. After finding my cat unresponsive and unable to breath 9 months later I had to rush him to a new vet as my regular vet was unable to see him due to covid 19. The emergency vet referred me for further treatment to a specialist hospital. At that time my cat was put on Oxygen in intensive care and diagnosed with asthma. He was released on bronchodilators and has responded well to treatment. Embrace have covered one small bill from that day around $290 but denied all the others because they claim asthma is connected to a bacterial respiratory infection 9 months ago making it a pre existing condition. I have been able to show with vet notes and a video that the symptoms now are nothing like 9 months ago and not ore existing. Now Embrace have switched to denying my claim of over $2000 because the emergency vet notes  Say that I had said my Cat ALWAYS made squeaky wheezy sounds. I had not said that ,  my 15 year old daughter commented that he had sounded wheezy/ squeaky RECENTLY in her bed at night  but Embrace have now decided to cling to this. The vet who wrote this did not treat my cat at the time and the information she got was from four different team members who spoke to us in a chaotic parking lot on the day itself. It does not matter to Embrace that 3 other vets have never cited this or put it in any notes, they just don’t want to reimburse me so are using these inaccurate notes to deny my claim. Their communication is poor, I am still waiting for so many responses from them, the appeal was supposed to take 14 days and I had to chase them on day 26 for a response. Overall I am very unhappy and would not recommend them.

5ed8005925e5d209b8fc1e3b,False,False,"I wouldn't recommend Embrace to my worst enemy. We have never, ever had such a terrible experience with a pet insurance company.

In February 2020, our cat became violently ill and could not stop vomiting on multiple days. After two of our cat's claims for vomiting were covered by Embrace, we found out that her largest claim for surgery ($2,162.65) where the diagnosis was also vomiting, was denied.

Embrace is claiming that a small bout of diarrhea in March 2019 that entirely cleared up on its own, requiring no vet appointment or medical treatment, is directly correlated to her recent GI issues. They are making an absolutely absurd claim that our cat's condition is pre-existing. Our cat was even seen for an annual wellness exam in July 2019 and presented no issues.

Our vet stated in a letter to Embrace that it is not possible for her recently-diagnosed IBD to have remained completely asymptomatic for 11 months, and the two GI issues are in no way related.

Embrace continues to decline to comment on our vet's letter or factor it into their decision. They stated that all the other claims due to vomiting were covered and the claims not covered were due to the mention of  IBD. The largest claim in question for $2,162.65 had the diagnosis of vomiting, and Embrace continue to contradict themselves. There have been several claims with the diagnosis of vomiting that were denied.

The best part? We were only $80 away from meeting our $750 deductible before Embrace started denying our claims, not having to send us any reimbursement checks. How convenient for them. They will look for ANY reason not to cover a claim. Honestly, what pet hasn't had slight diarrhea once or twice? We are counting down the days until our policy ends.

Just to share one more example to further prove my point, a recent claim for eye drops was also denied, stating that in July 2018, our vet noted herpesvirus. Herpesvirus is extremely common in cats, and an estimated 80-90% have it. Symptom severity is low and it's very easy to manage. Again, Embrace will look for ANY excuse possible to deny your claim. If your pet has ever had any issue, look elsewhere for pet insurance or Embrace will claim it's a pre-existing condition.

After all the stress and sadness of dealing with our cat's recent GI illness, we were at least relieved to know we had purchased pet insurance and were thankful Embrace would alleviate some of the expenses. Joke's on us. We could not be more disappointed with Embrace and hope sharing our story steers you away from them.
_________________________________________

EDIT: I’m truly sorry to hear your cat is going through something similar, Darcy. Regarding your response below, actually, Embrace denied the claim for $2,162.65 that was specifically for vomiting. I'd love to know how a slight bout of diarrhea that required no treatment or vet appointment qualifies as a pre-existing condition. That's like me getting food poisoning and vomiting for a day without any treatment needed, and 11 months later, developing acute pancreatitis in which vomiting is my main symptom, and my insurance company denying my claim because my vomiting 11 months prior from food poisoning is a ""pre-existing condition.""

Echoing someone else's review, diarrhea, vomiting, and lethargy are symptoms that present in most illnesses (both minor and serious) in cats and dogs. I could not feel more sorry for these pets and their owners after they discover their claims will not be covered due to Embrace’s ridiculous ""pre-existing condition"" language in the fine print.

In other words, in order for Embrace to be a worthwhile investment, a pet would have to be in absolute perfect health with not even so much as a slight bout of diarrhea in their medical records. I agree that Embrace does not support shelter pets, as most cats and dogs who are rescued will have at least very minor medical issues.

5ea4ed12086b640954405697,False,False,"Stay away from this company, they look for any possible loophole to NOT pay your claim. My dog developed a mass on her side and had it removed a few years ago. At the time, the vet told me that if it grew back immediately, then it would indicate that it was cancerous. 2 years later, the tumor did end up coming back. By this point, I had already purchased pet insurance. I took her into emergency because she was having a bad bout of vomiting, diarrhea and lethargy. The vets said she was very dehydrated and after some testing, there was some pancreatic issues. I submitted the claim for the $1,400 it was to take her in, and that claim was denied, as Embrace claimed that it was a pre-existing condition. I had to take my dog in back maybe 6-8 months ago because she had eaten a palm tree seed and was poisoning her. This current issue was an issue with her pancreas. That's NOT a pre-existing condition. If they are going to make the argument that Vomting, diarrhea and lethargy are ""a pre-existing case"", then there's literally no reason to have insurance with them since literally EVERYTHING that affects dogs gives them SYMPTOMS like vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy. Worms, cancer, poisioning....etc all give dogs the same symptoms. Just because they have the same symptoms, does not mean they have the same underlying condition, and it's criminal that this company thinks that's the case. 

During my dog's visit to the vet, they wanted to test the mass on the side of her body for cancer, and they determined that she did have a soft tissue sarcoma. Never been diagnosed before, hasn't been a pre-existing condition. Because that test came back as positive, I had to get her a CT scan to see if it was centralized to the tumor or if it had already spread. This hasn't been a condition of hers at this point, and cancer is a new diagnosis. So I'm feeling pretty good that the CT scan will be covered, but again, Embrace denied that claim. 

Then during the CT scan, the vet found a second tumor that was a mass cell tumor and is a completely different type of cancer. One that has never been on the body before, never diagnosed, never previously removed, brand new. NOT A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, and yet, Embrace STILL declined the claim for chemo medication that would fight the new type of cancer, saying that it IS considered a pre-existing condition because they can't prove the cancer before didn't cause the new cancer.

5e9b3a6d086b6409bc87b4e1,False,False,"We adopted a puppy, about 2 months old, who was found starving and dehydrated in a shopping center parking lot in Mexico. We were in Mexico for about a month with the dog and made several trips to the Mexican Vet. The dog had some skin and hair problems from over -exposure in the Sonoran desert and had some parasites. The Vet dewormed him, gave him his shots, documented  an International Vaccine card for him,  and wrote a letter to ICE, saying the dog was in generally good health by the time we left Mexico to return to the USA.  Shortly after our return to the states, we took him to a local vet who continued with some skin medication and started Giardia treatment. A stool sample after treatment indicated the Giardia was gone. We remarked to the Vet that he was still having loose bowels and the Vet suggested changing his food and/or trying a probiotic if it didn't clear. (As we are not allowed to bring dog across the border from Mexico,we bought a small bag of generic puppy food at a grocery store just after returning into the USA).We changed that food and the loose bowels resolved very quickly and he never required probiotics. As he never had loose bowels before returning to the states, it is most likely it was the generic food giving him some loose bowels.  Today he is a healthy happy pup and doing well. However, we realized after submitting the Mexican and USA medical records to Embrace there are enough ""pre existing conditions"" to make the policy worthless for us.
Following preexisting conditions were excluded for a full year
    Diarrhea and any related/underlying condition.
   Giardia
   Any and all dermatological or ear infections or parasitic conditions.

Comment sense tells me, after several conversations with Embrace, and reading the comments of other clients regarding non-payment of claims due to ""pre-existing conditions"", and being told we could hire an attorney to start an arbitration if we wanted, it is clear that nothing would ever be paid under this policy as any accident or illness would always be traced back to some preexisting condition. 
I understand that all insurance denies pre-existing conditions. However, a year is excessive in my opinion. And the year is not a maximum, but a minimum exclusion!
Also reading others comments about the large annual increases in premiums, I ran our $469  policy out for 10 years at a conservative 20% annual increase in premium. It totalled more than 12,000 dollars!

Taft suffered an episode in November which was diagnosed as gastritis  but it was found when he was neutered that he had suffered significant spermatic cord torsion.  I was willing to use my wellness benefits to cover the removal of the one testicle that had dropped but I feel the removal of the cryptorchidism was not an elective process it was a necessity.  Is it Embraces position that we should have left the testicle which was so badly wound around itself  behind the kidneys the Dr Proctor had to “tease”  (like  working a knot out of a string) it to fully remove it?  The testicle was then sent for testing to insure she had removed the entire testicle.  If it had been left we could have been facing far worse health risks for Taft.  I am thankful I have a Vet with the professionalism and skill to diligently perform this procedure.  Embrace should cover the cost of this part of the procedure because ultimately it saved them some major costly claims in the future.

Unfortunately, my kitty, Smokey, began losing weight. He was very sick and I was taking him to the Vet and after much testing, they found he had Triaditis and Cancer of the Intestines. Needless to say, it was expensive and had it not been for Embrace, I could not have given my kitty extra time and comfort before I had to send him to the Rainbow Bridge. Embrace made it so easy to submit claim forms for each Vet visit, each test, all the medication poor Smokey was on. They processed the claims efficiently and quickly. They approved everything that was covered under the policy I chose and the checks were in my hands so I could continue to try to help my kitty. Smokey was the sweetest, kindest cat I have ever known. I miss him so much. 

After I let Embrace know that Smokey had past, I received a beautiful sympathy card from them. The employees wrote individual messages to me and I can't tell you how wonderful that made me feel.

They denied the $697 claim, which would have amounted to them paying less than $300. And of course the overused ""previous condition"" excuse was used. A bad tooth is not a preexisting condition just because he had one pulled a couple of years ago. Ditto for fatty lumps. I have had three pet insurances over the past decade, and only one, PetPlan,actually paid a claim. But they were sold several years ago and their rates about tripled. I was hoping Embrace would be better, but alas they too deny deny deny. This is the last time I am going to spring for pet insurance. I will be opening a special savings account and sticking the $70 per month I was paying Embrace into that account. At least it will have some money in there when I need it!
Update:
OK, so you see embrace’s response. My point is, that as long as you take your pet to a veterinarian whenever care is needed, as in my case when my dog needed a tooth pulled, a blister on his eye taken off, fatty lumps that were interfering with his daily movements, etc., you will have established pre-existing conditions. The longer you have your pet, the less likely insurance is going to cover anything. In my case, they went back two years, found the other surgery, and denied the claim. They wrongly assumed that Pet plan, my previous insurance, use the pre-existing excuse. They didn’t. They actually paid the claim, but not until I was charged two separate $500 deductible‘s. Even though the surgery was done on the same day, they said the dental and lumps were two different problems, so each was its own incident. So rather than pay around $700, I got about 150. When I called Pet plan to complain, the woman actually was sympathetic, Saying she understood my point about who in their right mind would put a dog under twice for two separate incidences when it could all be handled at one time, the policy was the policy. In any event, before you buy any pet insurance, take into account that they are going to find some reason to deny your claim.

I panicked, knowing there was no way I could afford their estimate, especially when time was of the essence.  However, once I explained to them that we had Embrace, and was able to get a prior authorization for services, they were able to waive this policy and perform the much needed operations to try and save my kitty. Embrace fully understood the situation and spoke directly to their financial department, assuring them of our coverage and providing them with the estimated reimbursement that would be issued directly to them. The vet was then okay with me making a payment then and there and working on a payment plan for the rest. Although my precious girl did not survive due to complications, Embrace was there through the whole process, working with me and the vet clinic, orchestrating the payment and claims processing. It was a difficult time for our family, but I can't even begin to express how much Embrace relieved the stress of the financial situation and allowed us to focus on our efforts to save our kitty, and then through our grieving process as well.
