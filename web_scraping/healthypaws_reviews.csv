I purchased their policy with high hopes of ensuring the health and well-being of my beloved dog, but was left with a feeling of complete betrayal.

Their advertisements boast full coverage of unexpected accidents and illnesses, but when it came to actual medical necessity, they easily found a loophole to refute my claim. Paying your insurance premiums in good faith only to be disappointed when it really matters is just disappointing.

I strongly advise anyone considering pet insurance to look elsewhere. Healthy Paws may claim to have your pet's best interests at heart, but their actions speak louder than words. Save yourself the headache and find a company that actually delivers on its promises. And also, to my great regret, I began to read reviews about this company only when I was faced with this situation; if I had read the reviews before taking out an insurance policy for my dog, I would never have bought a policy from this company.

We have had our little rescue dog insured through Healthy Paws going on 10 years.   Dudley is far from being a pet,  but a part of our family in which we provide him the best food, love and medical care.  Just like you have medical insurance for anyone in your family to be able to provide health care we feel it is just as important to provide it for Dudley.   I was recommended by a good friend when we first got Dudley to go with Healthy Paws and we are so glad we did.  Poor Dudley has gone through some tough times. Not to long after we got Dudley he had to go though surgery to repair his right Patella,  about the same time I under went surgery for Thyroid cancer.   The following year my Thyroid cancer came back again and as well he had to undergo another surgery for his Patella on his left leg.    Following that things we good for a number of years until he was diagnosed with having an enlarged Liver and elevated Kidney levels.  This required ultra sounds and being on medication.   Through the excellent medical care we were able to stabilize him and he has been living a very happy healthy life.   Fast forward again a number of years and now we are again at a rough time in Dudley's life as he has heart problems that has progressively gotten worse.   We have Vet visits with a Cardiologist for Dudley about every 3 months and on additional medications.  Even though he is now dealing with the heart issues he again is happy and healthy for what he can be in his condition.   Through all this we have been able to get the very best care for Dudley.  Having this insurance has allowed us to go see Specialist such as his Internal Medicne Doctor as well Cardiologist who both work together to make sure we are doing the very best for Dudley.  If we did not have the insurance I would not be able to provide the kind of care my wife and I are doing for Dudley and see the very best Vets.   I just had a visit yesterday at the Cardiologist and like my other visits I submitted the copy of the receipt on line yesterday and less than 24 hours latter it was approved.

I called again and rep told me I did meEt the 15 DAYS waiting period because I bought the insurance on 10.7.23 and my claim was on 1.18.24. I still get denied and at this point. Today is Mar 7, 2024, I fill an appeal and I just want to cancel my insurance because it's no good but headache and time wasted to file claim again and again. my hope is not high that they will do anything about it. but it's definitely not worth so much time invested on filing a claim. I'm losing regardless if they paid my $194 bill. 

update: 3/8
so not only the reps did not know why they decline me, now the rep emailed me and telling me that it's because my pet did not have enrollment exam or medial records. they issued the policy for me without telling me that it is needed or what I sent initially from breeder (shots and dewormers and such) wasn't considered ""the medical record"" they should refund me all the money I had paid for the policy if I'm not even qualified to file any claim to begin with!",1,They will not pay your claim,0,2024-03-06T00:00:00.000Z,2024-03-08T00:48:45.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=6

She had a large mass on her spleen that appeared cancerous and had probably metastasized. She needed a splenectomy ASAP, but her platelets were dangerously low. She wasn't suffering, so we were committed to anything it would take to make her well again. She spent a combined total of 10 days in the hospital with a few days at home in between, while being pumped with meds to try increasing her platelets. Nothing was working, so as a last resort, we were presented with the option of a platelet transfusion in order to do the surgery. Unfortunately, there was still a very good chance she wouldn't make it through, and even if she did, chemotherapy would not be an option due to her low platelets. NOT ONCE did we have to consider the cost of the surgery and/or chemotherapy because we had Healthy Paws standing behind us. But not wanting to put her through all of that, we switched to comfort care mode, until her symptoms returned with a vengeance and we knew it was time to say goodbye.

Fast forward almost three years and Phoenix (large mixed breed) just needed major surgery. If not for Healthy Paws coverage he would have been unable to use his rear legs since the surgery itself cost more than I could afford. 

At first he had a partial crucial ligament tear in his rear left knee and was scheduled for surgery, but as he used his other rear right leg to support half of his body weight leading up to the surgery, he completely tore his rear right knee two days before the scheduled surgery on his rear left knee. As a result, the surgeon suggested it was best to operate on that completely torn rear right knee first. 

The TPLO surgery so far was a success and once this rear right knee has healed he will need another TPLO surgery for the rear left knee that was originally the only knee to need surgery. 

Within a week, I was reimbursed from Healthy Paws the 80% elected coverage from the surgery with ease. I cannot express how important it is to have a policy with Healthy Paws because like all insurance, you hope to never need to use it, but it is worth it when you need it.

The on-line claim submission is easy and reimbursements happen quickly -- usually within a week! Amazing. 

Premiums have risen, proportionate to overall cost of veterinary care. We were told upfront this would happen, but it would not be increased due to any claims. I've found this to be true.

Our first claim was after a bad car accident and Wolfgang was seen at an emergency vet. It was pretty late in a traumatic day so I called in the hopes someone could walk me through the process. A lovely, compassionate woman answered the phone and got the ball rolling. Rehab was recommended after the complex surgery, and Healthy Paws covered the number of visits the vet recommended. I am certain this is why Wolfgang doesn't have mobility issues at nearly 10 years old!

Eight years later, Wolfgang is having GI issues that our primary vet recommended we see a specialist for. Healthy Paws is still covering what we agreed to in the policy, in a timely manner and with compassion.

My friends told me that it may be possible that insurance companies will purposely keep delaying the process or even deny it.

The operation was very stressful for us as a family - mainly because we were worried about the outcome and the recovery of such a major surgery but also due to the cost of the operation itself.

Because the operation is so invasive, he required an overnight stay for monitoring along with medication to follow during his recovery. The estimate of the surgery was between $6700 to $7600. 

Due to the tremendous impact that this surgery would have on his quality of life, we decided to move forward with the surgery and we are happy to report that he is healing very well and is a totally different dog who can actually breathe now! (It ended up costing just under $7100)

So I want to share my experience with Healthy Paws pet insurance. I've had Healthy Paws for my golden retriever since 2019. We purchased the policy when she was 1 year old, so prior to any pre-existing conditions. She had an unexpected dental issue with what was basically the dog version of ingrown ""wisdom"" teeth in 2020. While the policy does normally cover most dental issues, we were pleasantly surprised when we submitted a claim for her issue for ~$3500 and it was reimbursed, with an explanation why - in this case - although it was dental it was covered under the policy (we did not expect that). Fast forward to 2023. We live in the SF Bay area, so an expensive place to live - including vet care. Accordingly our policy goes up a decent amount every year (we are at ~110/month right now). In October, our dog develop dilated cardiomyopathy. We're probably $5000-6000 in vet bills in the last 60 days and Healthy Paws has reimbursed us for every bill we've submitted. Not only that, the submission process is incredibly easy and they typically direct deposit the funds into my bank account within 48 hours.

Not, however, due to a pre-existing condition. But yeah, sure, let me do all the leg work to prove it is unrelated, since you can’t read and have no idea how labs work. Convenient for a (pet) health insurance company. A quick rundown - both humans and pets have a couple of commonly tested fluids, specifically blood, saliva, and urine. Urinalysis is not only completed to evaluate urinary tract health. I really just want to shout “DUH” at the morons processing these claims, and even more at the people writing their guidelines and training them.

I always knew I needed the best insurance to protect her health, so I picked Healthy Paws – and let me tell you, it's been the smartest decision ever.

For eight years, things were easy. Brownie was as healthy as a pup can be, just needing routine checkups and shots. Healthy Paws was there in the background, like a silent superhero ready to leap if trouble ever showed up.

But nine months ago, everything changed. Brownie got hit with bone cancer. My heart broke, but I knew we had to fight. That's when Healthy Paws became more than just an insurance company – they became our partners in this battle.

Filing the first claim was a breeze. No endless paperwork, no hoops to jump through, just quick and understanding support. Every single claim – all $30,000+ for radiation, chemo, surgery, even her heartbreaking amputation – was approved and in my bank account within 10 days! It was like a financial superhero delivering a truckload of cash, letting me focus on what mattered most – getting Brownie better.

But it wasn't just about the money. The Healthy Paws team was amazing. They called to check on Brownie, offered words of encouragement, and treated her like their own furry family. Their compassion was a lifesaver during those dark days.

Recently, Brownie's had another setback – congestive heart failure, likely from the chemo. And guess what? Healthy Paws is right there again, ready to fight alongside us.

My experience with Healthy Paws has been incredible. They've gone above and beyond, making them way better than any other insurance company I've ever dealt with, for pets or people. They're not just a policy, they're a promise of support, a safety net when the world throws you a curveball.

If you have a furry friend you adore, don't think twice. Get Healthy Paws Pet Insurance. It's not just insurance, it's peace of mind. It's knowing that no matter what life throws your pup's way, they won't face it alone.

655d290bf67907db8551207e,False,False,"I have been a very happy Healthy Paws customer since 2018, about 6 months after I got my Boxer puppy, who is now almost 6 years old. I did a lot of research before getting a dog on the pros and cons of pet insurance and everyone had strong opinions on the matter. Some felt it was a scam and you should just ""budget for vet bills"" when getting a dog. This would be ideal for all of us, but sometimes unexpected things happen, no matter how much you plan and budget. Others simply don't have the resources to pay for thousands of dollars in vet bills. Some felt pet insurance was a great idea as it provided critical support for their pet's health needs. I initially decided to wait, and after 6 months of ""puppy things"" that brought me to the vet on several occasions, I decided to purchase pet insurance. I did a lot of digging and came across Healthy Paws. I was drawn to them for a few reasons: they had great reviews on their customer service and there were various choices for pet owners, including annual deductible amounts and reimbursement rates (70-90%). Up until very recently, my dog has been fairly healthy with a few minor things/medications, etc. I have never had any issues being reimbursed at the 80% rate I selected. The claims process is SO simple and I generally receive funds in my account within 48-72 hours of filing. Most recently, my dog has had several vet visits and procedures to rule out bladder cancer.

After posting my review, a supervisor in the team connected with me, reviewed my case and approved the appeal. Payment was deposited into my account. 

I’ve revised my rating to 3 stars because they rectified the situation yet it required so many follow ups and posting of a negative review to get heard -I believe training is needed for their claims review/appeals team so customers don’t feel ignored the way I was.

I  do want to say the supervisor looking into my claim was extremely helpful and effective in solving my issue so do appreciate it.

I've been a policy holder with Healthy Paws since 2019 and this was my first time submitting a claim. My experience with the Claims Review and Appeals Review team has been sub par and am contemplating legal action.

The Claims team denied my initial claim because it did not meet policy, which was not accurate. I submitted an appeal and after waiting for close to a month the reviewer came back with information pertaining to another case (they were informing there was no evidence of a prostate issue - my cats are both females). I let them know I was requesting reimbursement for a tooth resorption situation, which they then mentioned was not reflected in the medical documents. I emailed them again the specific part where it highlighted it and that I'd like to talk about a supervisor about the handling of my case. Today I received an email saying my case was closed without any explanations.

It's so frustrating that after 4 years of paying my insurance I submit one claim and they pay no attention to it and reject without the appropriate reviews.

The impact Healthy Paws has had on our furry family life is nothing short of exceptional.

In the maze of pet insurance options available, it's only during moments of great need that you truly know if you've made a good choice. Throughout the years, Healthy Paws has consistently proven to be the best gift I could've given to my beloved cats.

When Francis faced a life-threatening emergency requiring surgery, I didn’t hesitate to authorize the procedure because I was confident that Healthy Paws had my back on the financial front. Beyond covering the bills, their personal outreach to check on Francis post-surgery showcased a level of care that goes beyond mere insurance. Even now, as Francis undergoes cancer treatment, Healthy Paws continues to stand by us, providing invaluable support.

As if having one ""problem"" child in the family wasn't challenging enough, our other sweet kitty, Ozzy, is currently navigating a health rollercoaster, and once again, Healthy Paws has proven to be our steadfast ally. Their consistent support and genuine concern make me feel like they are as dedicated to Ozzy's well-being as we are.

65300b0fedb4f4c4838fc8d7,False,False,"I've been a customer of Healthy Paws Pet Insurance & Foundation for over five years for my growing family of animals.  During that time, I'd (fortunately) never encountered any situation where the support of Healthy Paws was needed.

A few weeks ago, one of my cats became very ill, very quickly, and upon arriving at the emergency veterinarian, I learned that he needed surgery to treat an intestinal blockage caused by the sudden onset of a condition called intussusception.  After two surgeries and five days in the ICU, I was blessed to get my little guy back home, safe and sound, and he is currently fantastic and back to normal, making a full recovery.

I was prepared to spend whatever money necessary out of my own pocket to ensure that my little guy received the best care he possibly could, not knowing whether Healthy Paws would honor the claims I would submit. This thinking was influenced by stories I've read about other pet insurance carriers, as well as personal experiences with human health insurance carriers.

I ended up spending north of $15k on his care, which I would do again in a heartbeat.  Healthy Paws honored ALL of my claims, reimbursed the maximum to which I was entitled under my particular coverage, and did this within a few days of my submission of these claims.  The direct deposits cleared within 24 hours of the claims being processed.  Each claim was incredibly clear about what would, and would not, be reimbursed, and there were no surprises whatsoever.  When speaking on the phone with Healthy Paws representatives to answer questions I had, the team was incredibly kind, compassionate, responsive, and helpful.

I am so thankful for the support of the team at Healthy Paws Pet Insurance & Foundation during this time and the peace of mind they've given me, and the support they've provided to ensure that my animals can receive the best care possible when it is needed.  I will be a customer for life.",5,Customer for Life,0,2023-09-29T00:00:00.000Z,2023-10-18T18:42:55.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=10
651e41c3ecb6f9356ed5512d,False,False,"I highly recommend buying Healthy Paws Pet Insurance for your pets.

First of all, you should always buy pet insurance, especially for a first-time parent like me, and it is never too early! You can rule out more pre-existing conditions. Also, even a young pet can get unexpected diseases. My cat Felix got diagnosed with cancer even though he is only 5 yo. Without my insurance, I could hardly afford the diagnosis procedure (lab test, blood work, etc.), let alone any treatment plan. But since I have the insurance, I can work with my vet to have some treatments for Felix to help him feel better, and seek help from more expensive specialists, without worrying too much about the financial impact.

Second, from my personal experience, Healthy Paws Insurance feels pretty decent. The premium is not that expensive (at least for young pets, my cat was still young so I don't know how it will turn out for more senior pets) in my case. I didn't set a super low deductible though, you might need to pay more if you want a lower deductible, but I feel good with mine. It covers the diagnosis and treatment of almost every disease, as long as it is not a pre-existing condition. I know it doesn't cover any dental treatment, which I do feel kind of disappointing. But I don't know if there is anyone in the market who covers it so I am fine with it. It doesn't cover the office visit fee or consultation fee, which is a bummer, as I live in a place where the office visit fee is quite expensive. For the pre-existing condition, I don't think you should turn around if your pet already has any condition (unless it is lethal), because it can still have you covered in other situations. And one tip, if you plan to buy the insurance and your pet is healthy without any medical record, take it for examination as soon as possible to rule out any pre-existing conditions. The reimbursement process is also very quick in Healthy Paws. I usually get my reimbursement 2~3 days after I file the claim, and it is pretty smooth. And I like the fact that they don't have any cap for the reimbursement. Some diseases can get very expensive. I remember when I quoted all the companies, there are quite some that have a maximum reimbursement amount (yearly or lifetime). Some have adjustable caps based on the premium. And I would say those caps are usually too low for situations like accidents and cancers. Maybe it is because of where I live, but still, I feel it is very easy to exceed the cap in quite common situations.

Therefore, I would recommend buying Healthy Paws Pet Insurance because of my experience and the fact that I believe it is a necessity to buy pet insurance. I hope my experience can help you make the correct decision.",5,Recommend,0,2023-10-04T00:00:00.000Z,2023-10-05T06:55:31.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=10

What?? This means that if your dog is ok, you can pay them for YEARS before you actually find out that your dog might not be eligible after all! Even if they end up accepting this specific claim I think this is very DISHONEST. Apparently this is written somewhere in that very long contact they sent us (of course…) As you can read in other reviews here and in their app, you only find out how things are when you have a claim. They charge you for years but then they need to check if you are “really eligible”.

What a surprise it was to make my first claim in almost four years for my dog and get the “ run around”. I made the claim the middle of June and was assured that this claim would be reviewed by this past Wednesday- 7/ 20/23.  Several phone calls and faxes prior to this have been made. Today is Thursday and of course no response to have this claim settled has been offered. (all necessary paperwork has been sent twice )   My payments have been made on time ( drawn from a credit card) and I expect service to live up to their commitment ( usually 2-3 days processing time per their website).  I have no recourse but to warn others of the false claims Healthy Paws makes. I am retired and I chose this policy so that I would not have to “ worry” about giving my dog the best care possible even with my being on a limited budget. I wanted that reassurance of a healthcare plan that would take care of my “ loved “ friend if unexpected occurrences happened.

HP strong points: easy filing of claims and fast reimbursement (usually < 4 business days), compassionate and knowledgeable customer service, flexible coverage and deductible plans, and I've never once appreciated resistance from the insurer to cover under the terms of what was outlined in original policy documents.  Downsides include having to pay out of pocket upfront, no assistance with preventive care and exam fees (either regular vet visits or ER initial exam fees), but that's minor and I think fair considering what is covered.  I saw a review bemoaning the gradual increase in the cost of the plan, but that's expected as a dog ages and/or with the development of new medical problems.

So if they dont request records like they should that first year or any of the following years informing you they need it when your dog gets a life changing diagnosis at 5 years old and lots of vet bills they can say this is their baseline now because your previous vet permanently closed and you have no coverage even thou you have been paying monthly for 5 years straight.

My dog is 3 and has never experienced a hip issue.  What happened, and was documented in her record, was that I asked my vet when she was a puppy if I should give her glucosamine as a preventative to prevent any hip issues.  My vet endorsed that and documented that in my dog's record (that she's taking glucosamine).  This resulted in me being informed that if my dog ever had a hip issue it would not be covered by Healthy Paws.  They also went through a litany of other issues that would not be covered which were also questions that my vet documented. My dog is literally completely healthy but after changing insurance plans she is now tagged as having multiple pre-existing conditions that she won't be covered for.

They do not pay for any exam fees which when your pet has cancer is what costs the most. The actual part that they pay out of a $2500 bill is for the chemo which is only $115. Just about everything else that made up the $2500 bill was considered by Healthy Paws as an exam and therefore does not get paid back to the customer. Not only that, they do not actually pay out claims in the 2 day or even 10 days after submitting a claim. I submitted a claim back on 5.2.2023, today is 6.26.2023 and they still haven't paid for it. I called in, asked to speak to a manager who and I have it on recording, says there is no way to expedite my claim nor is there a set number of days where it would be considered to long to wait. In other words they can hold off on paying out a claim for over a year without you being able to escalate it to have it taken care of faster. You are at their mercy. I have been a customer since 2019 when i had the necessary exam done when I first signed up, and we had no issues or vet visits until recently and NOW they were telling us that exam we did after signing up wasn't eligeable because they didn't have the right medical records? All the records were uploaded. They wanted me to wait the 15 day grace period AGAIN starting 5.2.2023, even though I'd already been a paying customer for FOUR years at that point AND did the initial exam. I had to send the medical records for that 2019 exam several times until they decided they will look over my 2023 claims again to SEE if they can allow them to be covered. Why had I been paying for FOUR years when apparently they didn't have the information they needed? Only now do I find out? And now ALL of my claims (which I've had a lot now since my cat has cancer) are being held up. I'm over $6K down, thinking I was going to be ok because they'd cover 70% of the bills only to find out I've been basically lied to and IF they cover things, it'll be a small amount, and I could be waiting for them to even pay THAT out for basically ever.

1) You can only have 3 pets per email account. I have 4 pets, so couldn't get my fourth pet added to the same account. 
2) Issues getting claims processed: When additional information was requested, I emailed the documents, per their request. When I continued to get emails requesting the same information, I had to call so the operator could manually add the information to the claim. This happened for multiple claims. I shouldn't have to call for every claim to ensure the information I sent via the method they requested gets added to the claim. 
3) Claims getting denied: my most recent claim was denied. I have had 4 claims for the exact same issue (rehabilitation consult + treatment) approved for this pet. They are now making me appeal this claim because ""consult"" is not covered - even though rehabilitation services are covered and the exact same invoice item has been covered 4 times.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON PET HEALTH INSURANCE. They prove themselves to be a scam of epic proportions. 

I religiously paid my monthly fee to Healthy Paws Insurance for 9 years for my precious Wally, so in the event of an emergency I would be covered and not have to ask myself, ""Can I afford this service for my beloved."" 

Healthy Paws never ever ever covered any health services over the years. NOTHING. I had two emergencies over his nine years and they always had an excuse. 

Last month Wally was diagnosed with cancer. I wouldn't put him through chemo but there were emergency services just to figure out what was wrong with him. $4K later I had to say goodbye to my boy. Healthy Paws reimbursed me $375. That is $375 TOTAL over 9 YEARS and two emergencies.

So F YOU Healthy Paws. A big GARGANTUOUS F YOU. You don't care at all about your customers or their beloved fuzzy four-leggeds. You covered NOTHING over the course of nine years of paying every single month. A slap in the face to every pet owner. You are a scam. FAKES.

If you were even considering pet insurance, please just start your own pet savings account -- that is to say, put away some money every month in a separate account that you can access if/when your honey needs help. Pet insurance will cover next to nothing.  Healthy Paws isn't the only bad egg. They're all like this. 

@healthypaws F-you again.

To my beautiful Wally, may you rest in peace.

Filing the claim with Healthy Paws was easy.

Healthy Paws asked for the vet notes to be sent over to them as well,  and after my vet sent over the notes, I had a check in my mailbox covering exactly what they said they would cover. When my dog went in for surgery 2 weeks later, I did the same thing with the pet hospital bill, and again within 2 weeks I got a check from them that covered everything they promised to cover. The policy saved my thousands of dollars on the surgery. There were no ""fine print"" issues or ""got'cha"" technicalities.

They have been incredible in providing exceptional coverage and care for all the unexpected medical events an a couple (fortunately minor) emergencies. I recently got a plan for my new kitten as well after years of nothing but good things to say!

After getting neutered, a very minor surgery, my 8 month old kitten wouldn't eat and was not himself. What followed was a very stressful weekend of going from vet to vet for supportive care and next steps. We finally got a correct diagnosis: adverse reaction to anesthesia causing gastroenteritis. He was all set and back to normal after an overnight hospitalization with an amazing team and the right care for his needs. 

Through that horrible weekend, my husband and I didn't have to worry about the costs of our kitten's care because we knew Healthy Paws would help us. After roughly $4k in total expenses across multiple days and 3 vets, and having already met our deductible, we ended up paying $800 out of pocket in stead of $4000+. 

Healthy Paws is so fast to get through claims and answer any questions. On the phone, they've always been fantastic. I recommend everyone get Healthy Paws pet insurance and DO NOT WAIT. The sooner your pet is covered, the better. Trust me! The peace of mind when something unexpected happens is worth every penny of the monthly rate. They have different coverage options to help you find something that works. They will also reach out to vet offices for necessary records from claims you file so you're not chasing anyone around or playing middleman.

I have spoken/emailed SEVEN different representatives, and the issues are YET to be resolved.  They keep claiming I haven't submitted his medical records, and I keep resending them. Please note, the first time I submitted his medical records was when I enrolled, and I spoke with a representative to verify I had submitted everything needed. They are now trying to claim he has a pre existing GI issue, which is absolutely untrue. They are going off the date of his first claim because they are not organized enough to realize I have submitted his records multiple times and had multiple representatives verify they received them. This is starting to feel like a scam. I am starting to feel like they are purposely being difficult in the hopes that I stop try, and they get to save money. I am so tired of having the same unhelpful conversation with each representative. I truly am appalled at how disorganized this company is and can't even wrap my head around how poorly trained their staff are. I am hoping this issue will be resolved promptly, but I don't think I'll hold my breath. But hey, here's hoping the 7th time will be the charm.

In response to the reply: the first submission was indeed a line item record. I repeatedly submitted the rest of the records after I spoke to a rep in November and repeatedly throughout the claim’s process (once while actively on the phone with a representative, so she could verify it was what was needed). I finally took a screenshot of his most recent wellness exam (which I’d sent to records many times) and sent it directly to the claims rep and finally progress was made. The pre existing condition was removed from his chart, but boy was this a process.

I am very happy with Healthy Paws coverage for both of my pets! Both were added when they were approximately 8 weeks old, and in our case there were no preexisting conditions. With two hard-headed Australian Cattle Dogs, we are no strangers to bumps, bruises, and surprise vet visits - most recently, my older dog needed surgery for two mass removals AND an ER visit when she had complications. Submitting a claim is as easy as snapping a few photos of the itemized invoices and medical records, and usually my claims are processes within 10 days. Honestly, having this insurance was a huge relief knowing that I didn't have to worry about the cost of treatment; I could just focus on Opal! Members from the Healthy Paws team even emailed us to ask how she was going following her visit, which meant a lot to me. Instead of a canned/generic check up email, it was genuine concern and details from her submitted claims, too so I know that real, pet-loving people are behind the the screen. 

I recommend Healthy Paws to everyone, and will continue to do so! 

I also recommend that new policy holders read over coverage so they understand what is/isn't in their policy, and try to gain coverage EARLY for their pets to avoid preexisting conditions.

63d203169b64b1bdaf433f56,False,False,"Terrible experience with Healthy Paws. They basically make it as inconvenient as possible to get a decision about a claim as you keep paying the premium. I submitted records multiple times via the app and ultimately had to sit on the phone and email records for each dog to the customer service representative. I then had to read the records to her because she kept trying to say she didn't see a date on the medical record that was clearly on the medical record. After much time and effort I finally got the claim submitted that I had submitted a couple months before but they continually claimed they needed records for. Then they denied the claim I submitted for an antibiotic claiming that it was part of a wellness visit and that all that was on the claim was a receipt for anal glands. So now I have to spend more time appealing the decision because of their incompetence. I was only submitting the documents to have on record for future because these claims did not even meet the deductible. If it's this difficult to get claims just applied to deductible and they aren't actually having to pay anything I can't imagine having to file something they have to actually pay for. I pay way too much monthly for it to be this time consuming and difficult just to file a claim. I can just save the money and have it available in case it's needed instead of having to deal with them. I would not recommend the company. I would recommend just saving the money that you would be paying this company monthly instead of paying them to create more headaches for you if you ever actually need their services.

In response to the company reply: They can't find me in the system because I cancelled my account after leaving this review. I do not need to spend further time speaking to or emailing with customer service when this could have easily been handled over the past several months while the issues were ongoing and I expressed my frustrations directly to your representatives.

However, the second time was seamless--I had made 5 easy claims up to the point of the surgery and they quickly paid me out each time, all they need is the official invoices. 

Something important things to be mindful of that may result in disappointment--but I think these are the case with any pet insurance:

1.  As far as I know--they do NOT COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS or VISITATION FEES. The first is a bummer, the latter can rack up without realizing it. 

2. Once you make a claim, you can't change your plan, so you're either locked in, or go somewhere else that won't cover any new pre-existing conditions that occurred while covered here.

6331c59c5871ff1ef90acee8,False,False,"In my opinion, Healthy Paws is not the company they once were. They used to be good. Since changing underwriters a few years back, they have raised fees enormously, delayed claims and asked for medical records that they already have had over and over. I believe that may be a tactic to delay payment and then close your claim if you have not supplied the info you already supplied them within 90 days. In my opinion, they also try to get older dogs off the policy by raising fees so high as the dog gets older and is more likely to need the care.There was a class action filed in Washington against them, complaints on file with the California Insurance Commissioner, issues in Florida and other  states.  You only have to look at Yelp and some other sites to see some of the issues that customers have brought up recently. They have really gone downhill in recent years.Myself and some other customers have stated online that they used to be good, but not anymore. The difference is night and day in comparison and that likely is a result of the change in underwriters.

With regards to the reply by Healthy Paws- They are stating they can't find my account. Again unorganized and delay tactics on their part. They said they could put a Liaison Manager in contact with me. No, a Liaison Manager already put this off on somebody else in the company after 3 emails and a month long wait before I got a reply from them and was for the Liaison manager to push it off on some other department that never gets back to you. This is why I filed a complaint with the California Insurance Commissioner in the first place.

Now he is 2-year and is diagnosed with luxation patella. A surgery fix was suggested by the vet and the cost was around 3K. I can't tell you how frustrated I'm to hear this news. I did a lot of work to find a well-rated breeder and chose the almost most expensive one, but my baby still suffers from a health problem. I talked to the breeder and she said this puppy was the first sick one in her 30+ years of experience. I couldn't tell if she said the truth, but anyway, the accident could happen and I'm grateful that I enrolled my baby in the insurance when he was young so this accident was covered. going through surgery with your pet is super tough, it's even tougher than getting the surgery on yourself both physically and mentally as well as economically, and the insurance now plays an important role and makes sure you don't need to ""give up"" therapy due to budget. 

The reimbursement process of healthy paws is very fast, my first claim was processed using around 1 week, and my later claims were processed using 3 days. They also don't increase premiums a lot when your pet gets older compared to other insurance.

6318d70a6a3e1ed2c3cca376,False,False,"HealthyPaws has been nothing short of amazing for our dog Teddy. This was our first pet we had insured and it was mainly only done due to hip dysplasia worries. We enrolled him as soon as we got him in 2015. Teddy is an Akita/German Shepherd mix and past experiences with dogs that big have always had arthritis and hip issues down the road. So we enrolled him in 2015 on the 90% coverage, $100 annual deductible plan. It has been a literal lifesaver for him and our family and likely one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life.

I tried Figo Pet Insurance with 2 of my other dogs and they have been nothing but headaches and drama dealing with 1 of my dogs who sadly passed due to osteosarcoma spreading to his spine. They take weeks and weeks to look at your claims and in his case it was usually almost always denied or with a problem. Sometimes they would cover bloodwork, sometimes they didn't. It was crazy, a nightmare to deal with and I highly recommend everyone avoid Figo at all costs.

HealthyPaws has never had that sort of problem. They have covered little things like UTIs, monthly glucosamine shots and antibiotic meds. But they also have covered MAJOR life-threatening things without any issues for Teddy. Teddy had a mast cell tumor removed from his chest in fall of 2017 after adopting him. Every penny of that bill which was over $3,000 was covered with no issues at all. In fact, only ONE time in roughly 100 claims have I ever had a issue and all it took was a simple phone call for that to be resolved. The turnaround times are very reasonable and fast, never takes more than a week or two tops.

In June 2022, Teddy started having severe neurological signs and a brain tumor was suspected. To make a very long story short, he ended up having to have stereotactic radiation and chemo. This is certainly not cheap, his bill was roughly $15,000. HealthyPaws paid EVERY single penny of it except the usual things they do not cover (exam fees etc). I was reimbursed for 90% of that entire bill. They even emailed me to check and see how he was doing. They just spent over 13k on Teddy and still care enough about him to see how he was doing. HealthyPaws is amazing and I won't even consider another pet insurance company moving forward. 
He gets his bloodwork checked almost every week now, monthly chemo meds and other meds. All of this is covered without issue and pet owners know how expensive weekly blood tests can be. HealthyPaws is AMAZING, I cannot stress this enough. I have already recruited a friend to enroll their new puppy with them and I hope this review can help others make the proper choice here also.

Teddy is thus far doing as well and roughly 90% of his former self. Our family and Teddy owes this all to the wonderful care he got from the doctors but also HealthyPaws.

The insurance company’s response to my review does not answer the following question, which I asked them back in 2021:  why didn’t your competitors increase their premiums as much as you did?

62f5b2d44c35e69ec52aa9ca,False,False,"Great rate starting. My dog is now 4 years old and very healthy. Somehow my premiums increased from the original rate of $33.61 on 3/11/19 to the absolutely absurd $70.62 they are now charging me as of 3/11/22. Don’t worry, they totally let me know about the price increases by creating a document and stuffing it deep in the archives of my online account…you know, a very accessible place that most normal people check on a regular basis…oh wait, no, I never received an email or letter in the mail, and I never checked the documents in my profile, so I was never notified. 

I’m no mathematician, but a 110% increase in only 3 years with NO claims that they had to pay me out for seems ridiculous. It’s a simple bait and switch…preying on peoples fears of the unknown. 

Now, they will claim that rates are adjusted to reflect market price for vet services, inflation, etc, but nothing has gone up 110% in the pet world. Pretty sure my vets prices are somewhat similar to when I started going there. 

This is a terrible business model. Provide affordable coverage for young dogs, jack the price up significantly, and make sure that by the time a dog is old and would need medical attention, the customer would have already canceled the policy because they could not afford it. 

If you are thinking of getting this insurance, consider that I am paying $847 a year for the coverage (22-23). That is in addition to the $678 (21-22), $522 (20-21) and $403 (19-20) I’ve paid them for the past years. That’s $2,450 that I’ve given them to “protect” my perfectly healthy young dog. By the time I would need coverage, I would’ve already paid more in insurance than I would’ve paid out of pocket. Then again, if something unexpected happened to the dog, I would’ve needed the coverage. But like I said, that’s their business model…prey on your fear. I wish nothing good for these people who make the policies to screw over people who try to do the right thing for their pets. I hope they get theirs one day.

No one likes premium increases, thank you for pointing that out. Please explain, on this public forum, why an insurance premium increase of 110% is appropriate within 3 years. No need to access my account to identify the “factors” that contributed to the increase. All I’ve done is pay you. No claims on my end that make my account a higher risk than anyone else. Please enlighten us. 

And if your sticking point is you’ve sent an email with the increase information (maybe I missed it), you are missing the point. I don’t care about it not being communicated. I care about your ridiculous, unjustified price hikes.

HealthyPaws insurance gave me the peace of mind that if anything ever happened to my dog I would always be able to help her without worrying about the cost of vet bills. At just 2 years old, sure enough my dog tore her CCL in both hind legs. That came out to around $8000 for both TPLO surgeries not including the visits I made to the specialist to figure out what was wrong with her. With HealthyPaws I received 90% of that back. Without HealthyPaws insurance I don’t think I would have been able to get the surgery done for her so soon and her limping was pretty bad so I’m grateful I was able to help her right away.

We have maintained coverage for our dog and cat for 6 years, and never really needed it until this year, when our dog Hammy tore a knee ligament and needed surgery to repair it. After we met the annual deductible, Healthy Paws paid their share of the remaining bills with no trouble at all. The vet also prescribed medication to relieve arthritis in Hammy's other knee, and this was covered by insurance too. Claims are paid very quickly via direct deposit, and customer service is helpful and friendly when needed. The ""preexisting conditions"" exclusion is disappointing, and annual rate increases are never fun, but I suppose that's standard practice for the industry.

There was a high probability that it was cancer but, even if it wasn't, the danger to him was grave if the mass burst, as it would fill his abdomen with blood.  We opted to do surgery right away which would include removing the kidney.  The estimate for this surgery was very high.  As such, I decided to look back for all the vet bills that I hadn't filed an insurance claim for, during the current policy period, and frantically started sending them in just hoping they would cover enough to satisfy our deductible.  There were 20 submissions, and the speed at which they reviewed, approved, or denied them, was record time!  They approved many and denied very little.  Not only did we meet our deductible, we blew by it, and they direct deposited funds to my bank account within a few days.  I was so happy and very surprised!  Given my experience with a different pet insurance company years ago, I anticipated much less.  Needless to say, I was impressed, but not half as much as I would be.  After my dog's surgery, I submitted the very large claim immediately.  It was long and detailed, as he'd spent 3 nights and 4 days in the hospital.  I was hoping that, whatever Healthy Paws was going to cover, they would review the claim quickly enough to put money in my account before the credit card bill arrived.  I was shocked when I received notice in only 3 days that they had completed the claim and deposited the funds into my account.  Not only did they do it in lightning speed, but they covered every single item on the claim.  Now I was extremely impressed!

So I spend more of my time getting all the vet records (he's a rescue, no easy task, would've been MUCH easier THREE years ago when I joined.) They finally process my claim. They're only paying half of a very expensive bill. Turns out ""Hospitalization"" is covered but not the exam fee? What??? How does that even make sense. Sounds like a way to get out of paying short term hospitalization to me. Not to mention how much time and stress (3 customer service calls SO FAR) I've wasted just trying to get them to do their job. I specifically signed up for them bc I was led to believe they covered the big stuff. I guess not. So if you like being stressed out right after your pet almost dies, having a company implying you're a liar, not getting your money's worth, this is the company for you. Oh! And they also request the vet records because if you don't get that first exam per their requirement, they don't have to pay your first claim, even if you've been paying in.

One day, we returned home to George's rear legs being paralyzed, and it was clear something was seriously wrong. A visit to our local veterinary hospital led to an urgent referral to a specialist, to an MRI, and ultimately to back surgery. The overall cost was somewhere in the $7,000 range. Although the claim did take a little while to process, it was paid in full (at our 90% chosen coverage level, minus the deductible). Great, we got our money's worth.

Well, two years later... the same thing happens, this time a spinal issue further up his back. Same drill: local vet, immediate referral to specialist neurology department. MRI. Surgery. Cost: over $10k (first instance was in Michigan, second in Southern California). This time the claim was submitted and paid *the next day*. I couldn't believe the quick turnaround.

No quibbling, or trying to get out of paying. Knowing you can trust your pet insurer to pay up when you need it can be the difference between being able to say yes to a necessary procedure, or saying no.

Problem was, no pee was coming out. I immediately knew what was wrong...urinary obstruction. This condition is considered a medical emergency and having lost one of my babies to this 2 years ago time was not on my side. I rushed him to an ER vet but to my horror they turned me away (that's another review) so I had to head to my regular vet, even though they did not open until 7am. To make a long story short, I waited a short period of time until they opened. Met the one staff member at the front door, told her what was happening and she immediately got one of the Dr's. In less then 10 minutes, Baxter was successfully catheterized and draining urine. Baxter needed more care such as a bladder xray and a cardiac test as he had an arrythmia of unknown origin. Needless to say I was a wreck from all of this and when Baxter was stable and the testing was done I asked for the medical notes and prepared to send everything to healthy paws insurance.

So we submit all the documents to claim the payment back from ""Healthy Paws"". After a back and forth of many phone calls where they asked for any possible document our cat ever produced in his entire life, they declined to pay any moment.
The reason: when you enroll a pat that is 6+ years old with them you need to have a veterinary test that is 30 days prior to the enrollment date. Our was 6 days too early, so basically we were paying for almost 2 years a lot of money to the company but we didn't have ANY coverage. 

Basically what these people do is that they check you only when you claim something, and they look for ANY small detail to avoid paying you. you could pay for YEARS a service that you don't even have.

I cannot believe how fast they are able to process my claims and deposit their reimbursement into my bank account, and they go above and beyond by reaching out after her surgeries to see how she’s doing.  I simply cannot recommend HealthyPaws enough to my friends and family.  Whether you just got a new dog or you’ve had yours for a few years now, the low-cost monthly fee for HealthyPaws is worth the peace of mind that comes along with knowing your dog is insured if a problem ever arises.  I honestly would not have been able to provide Nellie with the healthcare that she so desperately needed if it weren’t for HealthyPaws.  Don’t wait until a health issue or unfortunate situation occurs.  Get your pet signed up for HealthyPaws so that you can take on whatever problem might come your way. After all, we all want our furry friends to be with us for as long as possible and live their best lives!  HealthyPaws allows that to happen.",5,Couldn't be more pleased with Healthy Paws,0,,2022-03-17T17:12:11.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=38

622cea3431617ac0e4847265,False,False,"Even if I lose you somewhere while reading my review, please purchase a Healthy Paws pet insurance for your pet now. This is not like deciding whether to purchase your baby a duck toy or a squeaky ball.  For the past 8 years Healthy Paws has saved us money we sometimes didn't have. It has allowed us to focus our energy and time on providing Mossi the best vet-care, rather than worrying about money. You don't want to avoid a visit to the vet because you cannot afford it. There is a lot of information online and in social media, which can be very overwhelming. It can also be very misleading, but the go-to for many people because it accessible, and cheaper. I do not recommend this at all. Make sure your pet is covered with Healthy Paws, take them to the vet, and every other source of information should always be confirmed by your vet. Before I do lose you (as you may think I am long-winded) think of surgeries and cancer, which are very common. Waiting until a sickness or odd-bump passes or goes away because it is not “big deal,” or avoiding routine examinations because “what if they are too expensive” - should never be the decision-process regarding your pet’s health. Pet insurance removes that financial obstacle. Your pet/baby's life may be short, but you can extend them and make the more comfortable with the proper veterinary care.

As soon as we welcomed Mossi Banana into our lives, we purchased a Healthy Paws policy. It came to use right away! Two of the best decisions in our lives! My precious Yorkie, as is the case with the breed, has struggled with allergies, food sensitivities, osteoarthritis, and an incessantly curious and excitable personality that cannot be cured. Our journey with her tummy issues, food and seasonal allergies that change from year to year and as she ages, two surgeries for ruptured ligaments on her hind legs, a fractured tooth (she is a hard chewer, avoid plastic or antlers), have all been very stressful for Us and Her. However, the stress fades away after the visit to the vet when she starts feeling better. We do not have to worry any more than needed because she is covered. I can’t imagine feeling conflicted about foregoing a veterinary visit or treatment because of the cost. You do not want to, either. 

Mossi takes various medications and supportive treatments for her gastrointestinal health and bone & joint health, which are covered by Healthy Paws. The surgeries for her hind knees, as well as her rehabilitation program did not have to be optional because we had Healthy Paws. You can decide not to do them, but without them you would be seriously and negatively affecting the length and quality of your pet’s life. When her recovery sessions needed to be extended, Healthy Paws covered them - no questions asked. I submit my invoices the day of the treatment, and I can have the money in our bank account within the same week, sometimes within couple of days – this is a life saver!  Preventative care and food is already expensive, but often doable if you have Healthy Paws to cover the rest. We have a tight budget, and can cover the preventative and food, but beyond that we would struggle and have to make difficult choices about our pet's health. You do not have to! 

As she ages, some of her health conditions are becoming more easily aggravated, which require more specialized care. Because we have Healthy Paws, we can afford an Internal Medicine Veterinarian that specializes in small dogs. Yes, there are veterinarians that specialize in many fields, but are usually more expensive. Specialized medicine can extend and even save your pet's life. It is more expensive, but it will not be an issue because you have Healthy Paws to cover your pet. I am amazed that Mossi's veterinary care and HP coverage are much better than my own human health care care and insurance coverage!

If you have a breed that is known for great health, get an insurance with the lowest deductible and/or lowest reimbursement. Later, you can change them! Cancer and accidents can be very indiscriminate no matter the breed. You will regret not getting a policy, you will NOT regret getting one because you will need it. 

 If you have a breed that is prone to health issues, get a HP pet policy immediately – and instead, spend the time and energy working with their vet, and doing your own research to learn about your pet’s predispositions and conditions so that you can provide them with best holistic care possible. Get a HP policy, it will make your and your pet's quality of life MUCH BETTER! You will have more money for toys, treats and trips with your beloved pet(s)!",5,"You will regret not getting pet insurance, but you won't regret not having it but not needing it!",0,,2022-03-12T18:45:08.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=39

We spent a week making daily visits to the 24-hour ER vet to be told on a Friday that her bloodwork showed she had life-threateningly low levels of some proteins in her blood and that the best option was being admitted to a specialist care facility that could monitor her over the weekend. 
It was hard enough to go through with that but thanks to Healthy Paws, the huge financial cost of the treatment was manageable. We paid upfront for the hospitalization and within a few days got reimbursed for 80% of the cost per the terms of our plan.

62210d85445f5107dca7739d,False,False,"I will attempt to make a very long winded review as short as possible. 

I have had dogs my entire life and for most of that time I was aware of pet insurance but I though it was a bit of a scam, meaning that it really only paid for emergency type problems and that it was not worth the cost.

Fast forward to May 2020 and I get a new puppy and the woman I am dating also has a dog and she tells me about Healthy Paws and how great it is. I get the insurance for my new puppy Ruby.

Healthy paws covers pretty much everything but exams, preventative medication (flea, tick, etc.) and vaccinations…. Everything else is covered.

So now the long part of how much Healthy Paws helped us. All of the ordeal I am about to go into was covered by Healthy Paws except for our deductible which was 20% and any exam fees. We calculated the payments from Healthy Paws to be around $35,000 over the course of this single problem.  In early 2021 Ruby started to have on and off vomiting, so we took her to the vet who did x rays and found no real problem, they though it was viral. The vomiting continued on and off a bit more so we took her to another vet for a second opinion. This vet ran bloodwork, did x rays and an ultrasound and still did not find anything.  Fast forward a few weeks and Ruby vomits blood so we take her to a third emergency vet who does an x-ray and an ultrasound and discovers that Ruby had part of a squeaker toy in her large intestine and it has perforated her intestine. It more than likely was in her stomach since she started vomiting but did not show up because it is clear plastic. When it finally made it past her stomach and into her intestines it because stuck because of the size and then perforated her intestine has her body tried to work the squeaker through her GI track. Ruby had emergency surgery that day and a blood transfusion to help with the blood she lost,  she spent 2-3 nights at the vet recovering and was doing okay. Because of all the blood Ruby lost she was anemic after the surgery so she required blood test every few days. As we had test, the vet noticed that Rubys red blood cell (RBC) count was not improving. After a week or so of additional testing, it was determined that the area on her intestine where it was cut and sutured by the vet had separated and the sutured needed to be restitched, so Ruby goes back in for a second surgery.  Ruby recovered okay for the second surgery but still was anemic with no improvement in her RBC count. We took her to three different vets (our regular vet, the emergency vet, and University of Pennsylvania Vet school). None could find a reason why Ruby was still anemic other than the assumption she had a slow bleed from her surgery site that they felt would eventually heal. At this point we are in July of 2021. Over the next 7-8 months ruby required 3 more blood transfusions, several ultrasounds and 30+ blood test to check her RBC count and other values. Here we are today in March of 2022 and Ruby is almost back to normal. She still is requiring monthly injections of iron and monthly blood test to monitor her improving anemia and RBC count.  

Everything I mentioned above was covered by Healthy Paws and reimbursements to us were often made the same day, I do not think we ever waited more than 3 days for a reimbursement of a vet bill. Healthy Paws also never questioned any of the bills and we never were required to get preauthorization for a specialty vet or surgery. The only time Healthy Paws ever had anything to say about the bills we submitted was them checking in to see how Ruby was doing and wishing us well.

Long story kind of short… get pet insurance. Without Healthy Paws we would have had to make very hard decisions about continuing Ruby’s care due to the cost, as the bills were $40,000+. We would have either burned through a lot of savings/gone into debt or had to put Ruby down.",5,Healthy Paws - best decision we made for our pets care,0,,2022-03-03T18:48:37.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=39

That's why I researched pet insurance carriers before I brought my new pup home in late 2018. Boy, did I choose the right company. When Bonzo needed tests (including an ultrasound) to determine why he was vomiting so frequently, Healthy Paws reimbursed almost all of the expense. When he needed a tooth extraction after fracturing it (still unknown how that happened), they covered 90% of the surgery and treatment. And when, a few weeks later, he developed a gastrointestinal issue that had me taking him to the vet a few times, I could focus on my dog's wellness without worrying about the financial hit, because Healthy Paws reimbursed 90% of the covered expenses within days. And when I got an email checking up on Bonzo? That made me smile.

Their reasoning was because the cost of services in my area. The only problem is that when I went to their website to get a new quote as new customer I was quoted $79 a month! They are scammers. I also got quotes from other pet insurance companies and was quoted even lower than that. This company doesn’t even cover dental for all that they are charging you. Maybe 5 years ago
This was a good insurance  choice for your pet but now this is clearly a company that is going downhill in service.

The plan that was given to BOTH my pets was only 70% reimbursement, had a $500 deductible, and no mention of no max payouts (which I assume means there's probably a fairly low cap on the maximum payout as well).

However, the year he turned 12, the premium nearly tripled, then doubled the year after that.

I have had dogs my entire adult life, and I knew when I got Iris that I wanted to make sure that she would get all the care she needed if injury or illness occurred. I did a little research and settled on Healthy Paws, which has turned out to be a great decision.

Recently Iris injured her knee and needed major reconstructive surgery. I had not yet filed a claim with Healthy Paws in the 3+ years that we've had the policy so I was nervous how it would go (having had to fight human health insurers in the past). 

To my surprise and delight, the claim filing process was easy and streamlined, all online. I received follow-up emails from Healthy Paws folks shortly after filing, and my claims have all been filled without hassle within a few days of being complete. They even wrote me a personal note to check in on Iris after her surgery.

To pet owners on the fence about insurance: do it. It is affordable, and even if it means you are just paying for your pet's healthcare in monthly installments (as premiums) overtime, it still makes it worth it to ease the burden of decision when the bad news comes that illness or injury requires expensive treatment.

61a909d62b49257fe292b2be,False,False,"Soon after I got my dog 5 years ago, I decided to go looking for a health insurance company for her. Not wanting to get hit with big vet bills if something happens was an important thought for me. 
Back then there were less reviews, but based on what I found, I decided to go with Healthy Paws for the following reasons:
- My dog was young and the wait period was only 7 days after initial vet exam
- No pre-existing conditions that I would have needed to get covered (as far as I know they are hard if not impossible to get covered)
- Comparing prices they were cheaper than others
- I didn't need routine vet care coverage

Over the last nearly 6 years my dog, unfortunately, needed medication and vet attention on numerous occasions and had multiple surgeries, not even talking about a full check up from an animal oncologist. The most recent surgery being a CBLO repair for her cruciate ligament in her back leg. 
After the initial claim, reimbursement claims are usually approved within 24 hours! I never had an issue with getting anything not covered that I expected to be covered. 
I get follow up emails from Healthy Paws as well asking how my dog is doing and if she is recovering well. This happened not only once but with every bigger claim I have filed. 

Now, why only 4 stars? Things to keep in mind:
- The exam fees are not covered, only medication, treatments/surgeries, rehabilitation. If you have ever taken your dog to a specialty vet, the exam fee doubles or triples to what a regular vet charges. It would be great if specialty  exams would be covered, at least for the amount above the regular vet exam fee.
- Premiums are getting higher and higher. This is also not a surprise, but unfortunately, because of the above mentioned 'no coverage of pre-existing' for most all pet insurances, just switching to a cheaper provider after price comparison is not really an option. So what we would do with car or home insurance, we can't do with pet insurance. The selection of a pet health insurance seems to be for the life time of the pet because of this. In more than 50% of cases, when one knee needed a surgery because of the cruciate ligament, the other knee will give out too because of over use. Cancelling or switching insurance would mean that that injury would not be covered at all. Again even with rising premiums they keep them just low enough so it makes sense to keep the peace of mind. 
- Premiums are depending on your location! Now, I get if you move out of state or from rural to metro, but I moved a town over and my premium per month was $10 higher. Moved 5 mils east (and actually closer to a more metro area, but same population density as before) and my premium went down $15 a month again. I get this for a car insurance, but for a pet health insurance? Seems weird to me.

6194077e8418c5556fedc29c,False,False,"Dear Healthy Paws,

I am 68 years old, disabled and on social security.  The love of my life is in your care.  My heart is in your hands.  

Without Healthy Paws, my little boy, Dude, would have had to be euthanized because I could not have afforded the doctors who are healing him.  I live a simple life.  It’s just Dude and me, 24/7 buddies.  We wake up together, walk together, play together and fall asleep peacefully together.  When Dude started having unexpected problems, Healthy Paws was right beside me, making it possible to pull him through.  I would have been shattered without Healthy Paws.

I was prepared to exhaust all my meager  savings to keep Dude alive.  I was prepared to lose my house to save him.  Healthy Paws prevented me from financial ruin and saved my best friend.

My best advice to people who love their pets:  Protect your “heart” with Healthy Paws insurance:

If you don’t have insurance, and you are researching, STOP as soon as you find Healthy Paws and enroll.

If you already have Healthy Paws insurance, do a good deed, and refer others to sign up.

Healthy Paws reps pick up every phone call.  The reps are compassionate.  They have pets of their own and they listen and wrap their arms around you.  They understand what you are going through and the fear you feel. They are efficient and get your claims moving  through the system to the right people.  They turn around reimbursements quickly and they deliver exactly what they promised you when you signed up with them.  

What does the future hold for me and Dude?   

During Dude’s stomach surgery, they discovered the source of his previous health problems.  He has a liver shunt that is preventing his liver from working properly to filter toxins and bypassing blood flow to his liver, damaging it.  He is scheduled for one last surgery, which will restore his liver so that Dude will “live a long healthy life.”  Dude is in God’s hands now, with the help of the skilled hands of his surgeon.  Healthy Paws is still by my side.

My hope is this.  I will dutifully pay my premiums every month for the rest of my life and NEVER HAVE TO UPLOAD ANOTHER CLAIM.  Dude will be healthy and he will live a long life.  I will watch him “sashay” down the sidewalk like he used to.  He and I will wrestle with his kitty sock puppet again.  And every night, like he always does, he will wrap his arms around my neck and he’ll fall asleep on my head.

Thank you, Healthy Paws.  You did all this for me and much more.

61909f13fb38891f5f0b1ac7,False,False,"People rarely take the time to write good reviews. If the company does what it promises, we’ll that’s expected. I had two dogs (one has passed, unfortunately) with another insurance company. It has not been pleasant. When I got my first pet insurance policy, I really didn’t do a lot of research. Having experienced terrible customer service, lifetime limits (my fault), and up to four months to settle a claim, I did a lot of research when I got a new puppy. I chose Healthy Paws. So let me tell you  about my first experience. He was hospitalized with pneumonia two weeks after I signed up with Healthy Paws. I sent them the invoice and doctors notes. The claim was settled two days (yes two days) after my submission. The money was in my account the third day. They reimbursed the exact amount that was stated in the policy. That was a year ago. I posted this experience on Facebook, and it turns out, many of my friends use Healthy Paws.  They all said they had similar experiences. Over the past year, I have submitted claims for minor illnesses, and the experience is the same.  The money is in my account within 7 days of submission. Given my experience with the other insurance company, it is extremely stress less and straight forward. Healthy Paws might be a little more expensive, but absolutely worth the cost. 
So just a little advice if you are doing research. Lifetime incident amount is critical. If your breed is susceptible to certain disorders, take that into consideration when you sign up for the lifetime limit. With my other insurance company. (I still have an old dog and I can’t take him off that policy) I had a $5000 lifetime incident cap. He is a clumber spaniel and they are prone to get hip dysplasia. He has had two operations for hirneated discs. I maxed out on the first operation. My new dog is also a clumber spaniel, so I signed on to a 25k max. Hopefully, it will be a complete waste of money.

Just take a photo of your bill, push send and you're done.  It really doesn't get any easier.

Our previous company based reimbursement on what they felt was customary and fair by comparing rates in other states, as though I was supposed to find those vets and travel a bit.  When researching pet health companies, you may want to ask them what, exactly, constitutes a pre-existing condition.  We found out the hard way when our previous company stopped paying for cancer treatments for our dog because the policy renewed in the middle of treatment.  Anything connected to her cancer was now considered pre-existing.  Healthy Paws doesn't work that way.  We have had some unexpected expenses with our dogs, as do many people.  The peace of mind Healthy Paws offers is something I am not willing to give up.  They are so easy to work with, their reimbursements are fast and fair, and my dogs will always have them to watch their backs.

No way could we give her up. A few months before her first birthday we noticed she would limp after extended running or playing with other dogs. We took her to our vet and he diagnosed her with ununited anconeal process and urged us to take her to an ortho specialist. We did so and after a CT scan, ortho diagnosed her with ""bilateral fragmented medial coronoid process of the ulna with secondary elbow osteoarthritis, bilaterally (BOTH LIMBS).

We took her for surgery (ulnar ostectomy - bilaterally) on a Monday - which lasted over 3 hours. She was hospitalized overnight. On Tuesday, we picked her up and paid our bill (over $10k up front). I submitted a claim to Healthy Paws on Tuesday and sent Zoe's medical records on Wednesday.

I immediately did a lot of research on insurance providers for pets. Healthy Paws Pet Insurance was rated very highly plus they had no maximum limits on claim payouts and provided reimbursed on 90% of an emergency medical cost. These are the reasons to purchase insurance; to cover the cost in case of emergencies.

One day while out, Daenerys drank from an anti-freeze puddle in a parking lot. After talking to the vet hospital, we immediately decided to take her in for treatment. Even small amounts of anti-freeze can kill most pets, but by the time you see symptoms it is usually to late. The hospital did find anti-freeze toxins in her blood, and she underwent dialysis for five hours to save her life.

After the procedure I filed a claim with Healthy Paws. I was worried that they might reject the claim for some reason and would have to fight to get the payment. We had only paid nine months of premiums at this point and the bill for the hospital was over $5,000, so they were losing money on this payout.  But Healthy Paws came through for us.

613fa86b6223e22118af7ab2,False,False,"After a year of vet visit after vet visit, I really have to hand it to Healthy Paws. My cat, Nemo, has had a pretty traumatic year, health-wise. Between an FIC diagnosis and some strange GI symptoms that we're still getting to the bottom of, he's been in-and-out of a string of vets' offices, has seen a few specialists, and has made a number of trips to emergency vets. Throughout the year, he's probably endured a half dozen series of xrays, three ultrasounds (two with sedation, one with a specialist), and at least 5 blood panels. None of this would have been possible without Healthy Paws. 

Thanks to our coverage, I can always say ""yes"" to the vet when another test is proposed or avenue explored. I've never had to decide between his care and my wallet. Most fantastically, his FIC is the most stable it's been in ten months and we've ruled out all the ""scary GI culprits"", so we're likely looking at an obscure intolerance. I'm feeling hopeful for the first time in a long time. 

While Healthy Paws doesn't cover routine care or the exam itself, when a pet is truly experiencing a health crisis (and the bills are rapidly adding up), it becomes very apparent very quickly how valuable pet insurance is. Nemo would have to live 33 years at our current monthly rate for us to ""lose money"" on this plan (additionally, the peace of mind this insurance provides cannot be put into a monetary figure, but is even more valuable, in my opinion). While I hope I never face so many health challenges with another pet, it's great to know that Healthy Paws will always be there. 

I am so thankful to be writing this review with my beloved boy snoozing away on my lap. He's just celebrated his sixth birthday, a milestone I feared we wouldn't reach a few months ago.

613a2e93215cfcced2614587,False,False,"I have had the insurance for both of my cats for the past 2 years and I will confidently say the decision was one of the best decisions I made. 
My cats were both 5 and 6 when I got the insurance coverage and they didn't have any previous history of diseases. They were all rescued and not any specific breed so no genetic issues I know of. 
The process was easy from the beginning with all the documents submission done via the app. 
I got this insurance to prepare for any disastrous incidents. I didn't want to make any decision based on my financial availability if anything happen to my cats. And the monthly fee for both cats weren't too bad (initially $27 per month for both and now $33)
This decision paid off. Last year, somi got an aspirational pneumonia and I had to take her to an emergency clinic. At that moment, having the insurance allowed me not worrying about the emergency bills that might cost an arm and a leg. And when I got the bill, the healthy paw was so quick to process the claim and most of treatment was covered and lifted a great deal of my financial burden. Since then, I am recommending the healthy paw insurance for everyone. I know that there are many pet insurance company with so many different coverage ( preventive care cover or dental cover) and when it comes to the claim, they never meet the expectation and give a hard time for the pet owners. I had a couple of friends also who experience the similar situations. And hearing that insurance horror stories and knowing how easy it was for me to claim for my case, I highly recommend the healthy paw insurance.

My other German Shepherd was severe hip dysplasia.  Since she was covered prior to turning 6 years old and did not show symptoms of hip problems within the first year of coverage, Healthy Paws has been a life saver for my poor pup.  For the past few years, she has shown extreme pain and we started anti-inflammatories (Galliprant) as well as gabapentin to relieve some of her pain.  This past year (at age 8), we performed x-rays and my vet said if we do not intervene with more invasive techniques, she would not see my dog making it through the next year.  We were referred to an orthopedic surgeon for possible total hip replacement surgery.  We decided to try the gold standard and replace her right hip on December 16th, 2020.  The cost was astronomical (almost 5 figures).  I submitted my claim to Healthy Paws on the day she was released from the hospital (December 18th). Due to the upcoming holidays and extensive medical records, there was a bit of lag between submitting and being reimbursed.  But the first week in January, I was reimbursed 90% (per my policy option) of the total cost of the surgery.  Healthy Paws literally saved my dogs life.

Asked for status at day 10, got canned response ""working on it"". 3 days later, I asked again then again at day 19, no response either time not even a canned response.

60e9fca8f9f48702a8965111,False,False,"This will be a long one. 

I decided on healthy paws only one month after getting my puppy after a trial period with AKC insurance due to the glowing reviews of HP on Reddit dog communities. 

Sadly, upon filing my very first claim I am disappointed to say the least. I read my policy documents from start to finish - I knew exactly what was covered and what wasn’t. In March of 2021, we had to take our goldendoodle to an emergency animal hospital due to a foreign body. I submitted the initial claim on March 18, which was denied one month later due to missing documents from prior to 9/2020. I had misunderstood the request and submitted some documents without lab notes. My bad, I contacted my current veterinarian, emergency veterinarian, and previous veterinarian to request full records with lab notes. While I was able to get records from my existing vet and the emergency clinic, my previous vet had a data failure, and only had the record from his puppy exam in Nov of 2019, one month before he was enrolled in Healthy Paws. This DID include lab notes - I’ll get back to this. I also had the test results from a urinalysis and blood panel from early 2020. I uploaded these documents and resubmitted the claim on 5/7 and stated very clearly that there was a data failure and these are all the records that exist.  On 6/15, I received a denial again (38 DAYS LATER) stating that records were needed from prior to 9/2020. WHAT. It took them 38 days to not even open the new documents I uploaded and deny my claim for the same reason. I called healthy paws on 6/16 asking what was wrong. The representative was kind but did not seem to understand what documents I had uploaded were - she did however advise me that she would submit the claim for appeal, and that she would make a note of the data failure of my previous veterinary office. I also re-uploaded the 11/2019 puppy exam record in case the original upload wasn’t successful. Later on, I got a response that my line-item invoice had been reviewed but they need the lab notes. Now, the format of this had the line-items on the first half of the page and then listed the vet’s lab notes under it. If they actually read it they would realize this, but I’m guessing someone just glanced at it. What, do you want me to highlight it for you? 

I hadn’t heard anything about my appeal, so I sent an email inquiry on 7/5 to confirm if my claim had actually been appealed. Understanding they were closed for a national holiday I expected to hear from them later in the week. Well, it’s almost a week later, and I have heard nothing. The app and website mention nothing of an appeal. It has been four months. FOUR. Their documentation says roughly 10 business days. 

A quick recap, my dog (who has been enrolled in healthy paws since 12/12/2019) ate a toy at a dog park in 3/2021, and they can’t approve my claim because the records from 1+ year ago no longer exist and their claims processors can’t read. I’m pretty sure he wasn’t born with a toy in his stomach, so I don’t even see why those records are relevant. Customer service seem like very kind people but the reps on the phone seem to have no authority to do anything and are completely separate from the claims process. As I understand it, it’s pointless to even have this insurance because I will never have a claim approved due to the data failure that I have no control over. Almost two years of premiums for nothing. Not to mention, because I have submitted a claim, even though it has been denied, I can never opt for a higher premium and coverage level - for the rest of the time I am a customer - which is a terrible policy and is clearly a punishment for submitting a claim. Unless something major is done to fix this, I will be leaving healthy paws, and I had never planned to do so before.

60e37036f9f487075039f8dc,False,False,"A little more than three years ago, when I got my Australian Cattle Dog, I was skeptical of the need for pet insurance. Cattle Dogs are generally healthy in the long term, my thought. I got Mojave to be a trail dog, as I hike approximately 120 miles a month.
After thinking it through, I realized that given the miles Mojave would be covering, the odds of an orthopedic or paw injury was above average.
So I decided to get Healthy Paws Insurance. For the first 3 years, we had no issues. I thought of my pet insurance as I do of my car insurance... A 'necessary evil'. No offense Healthy Paws!
But in April of this year, Mojave injured a rear paw. It has resulted in Veterinary care to this day. (he is well on the mend now)
Thank goodness for my Healthy Paws insurance! His treatments were very costly, and Healthy Paws was there for me. Not only that, filing a claim and getting reimbursed, couldn't be easier.

I left a 5-star review recently for Healthy Paws because it was easy to submit the claim for my dog's TPLO surgery (after he tore his knees/ACL in an accident), and pretty easy to get payment. That still stands. 

But less than a month from that claim, I got an email saying that my monthly premium has gone up 50% - now at over $270 per month. (I checked competitors and they're still charging around the previous amount of ~$180 for my dog's city/age/breed/etc) They say premiums do not go up because of claims, but it feels suspect. I reached out to ask, and the generic reason they gave was that overall pet owners have been submitting more claims, they're paying more out, and now they have to increase prices. My dog's only 6...I can't even imagine how much premium they'll try to charge by the time he's an elderly dog.

When we adopted our dog Luna in 2014, I researched all the major insurance companies. The main differences among the companies had to do with cost, the deductible (per condition versus annual), and the approval process. I decided on Healthy Paws because while new to us, our dog was an adult and formerly stray, so I didn't know what we'd face in the first year (injuries, various illnesses??), so an annual deductible made more sense to me, in case there were multiple different vet visits. 
While Healthy Paws doesn't offer a pre-approval, it's been super easy to file claims. If for a vet visit, their office can email the Healthy Paws claims department directly; if I'm picking up medication, I can submit a claim online. Healthy Paws has always reimbursed us very quickly (like 1-2 days) and has covered dozens of claims at this point for surgeries, medical tests, and prescription medications. I've never had a claim denied that I expected would be covered. 
Any time I've needed to call Healthy Paws to check in about a quote from my vet's office, or straighten out my paperwork (lately sometimes I've needed to make multiple claims per week and have mixed receipts, oops) -- the customer service representatives are SO nice, SO lovely to talk to, and are clearly animal lovers who are happy to help pet people out. Over the past year Luna has been really sick and it's been *such* a relief to know that Healthy Paws will cover the various tests our vet has proposed -- it makes taking care of a pet so much easier. It's definitely been a good financial decision for us to pay for insurance since 2014; the reimbursements have outweighed the cost as Luna has gotten older and had health issues.

60be7103f9f4870b701a01ff,False,False,"Same terrible experience. Been paying them for 5 years now, and every year they keep increasing their rates with the excuse ""the increases are in line with the increased costs of veterinary technologies.."". I just received a $30 monthly increase on a pet. $30! My advise to anyone new to the pet insurance business is do not get it. 
Once you start with one, anything that happens to your pet becomes ""existing condition"" for another insurance.
At the same time, your pet ages, and the premium keeps going up with Healthy Paws, while the age puts your pet in an ""older price bracket"" with another insurance. 
Most insurance services consider ""pre-existing condition"" what has happened to your pet in the year prior to the renewal billing cycle. They renew your policy every year, but even if you have been with the insurance for 5 years, if your pet has had a problem during the previous policy term, it is considered ""existing"" and not covered. Have not experience this with Healthy Paws because I have not had any claim what so ever in 5 years.
if you do the math of how much you pay every month, and how much the premium will keep growing every year, and how much your cat ages which puts you in a more expensive premium somewhere else, you are better off savings money on the side for your pet every month and spend when and if an issue arises. 
Also, as the policy keeps renewing every year, and they make changes to the policy, chances are that by the time your pet is very old (14years+), the insurance company will no longer pay, and will drop you from their coverage service.",1,Same terrible experience,2,,2021-06-07T19:18:27.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=56

I started with them in 2013 and I paid around $35.00 a month. It was raised to $76.20 on December of 2020, which I justified because they were amazing. When I received my bill on January 29,2021 I called and cancelled my policy because the insurance was raised again to $114.30 a month.

When I received my credit card bill in February they charged my credit card twice for $114.30 totaling $228.60 after the policy was cancelled.

I have spent endless hours trying to resolve this issue and they keep sending an email that they will contact me within three days and never do. It has been months and they DO NOT return phone calls and I have not been reimbursed.

I have referred this insurance to my friends, neighbors, co workers and his daycare and everyone is dealing with the same issue. All of our prices went sky high and they keep charging our credit cards.

What was a delightful and casual little get together became my worst nightmare when a balloon popped and startled my new affenpinscher pup. She jumped off my lap and broke her arm.

I started to panic more that this expensive event wouldn't be covered, but after submitting everything I had, I emailed and said that she was a puppy and had only been to the vet a few times. I received a nice email back saying she would let the claims department know. After that, I received an email that my claim was being processed and a few days later I had $4000 in my bank account.

608308a1f9f487093cccd183,False,False,"If you are going back and forth on whether or not you should/should not sign up for Healthy Paws insurance, I will be the first to say I was just like you. I used to be one of those “Why spend money on pet insurance, how much can they honestly get sick?”, and then I came to realize that it was one of the best decisions I have made (aside from adopting my pup of course!). Healthy Paws has LITERALLY saved my puppy’s life. 
My puppy at only 8 months old (healthy as can be, might I add) – decided to pick something off the ground on a walk, and swallowed this foreign object. He was not able to pass it so he had to get emergency surgery. Few days later post-op, he became septic from the first surgery, and needed to get another surgery, including a feeding tube + tons of antibiotics. The options I was given were to A: Get the surgery, or B: euthanasia… how could I possibly do this with a healthy 8 month old pup!? Fast forward to today, and my puppy has healed up and Healthy Paws has LITERALLY saved my puppy’s life – without having the insurance, I would not be able to pay for such expensive surgeries.
What we paid overall out of pocket was the cost of JUST the first surgery, meaning that Healthy Paws has saved us over $15K – and we spent under $5K. Also, compared to other pet insurances that have caps on how many claims they can submit, Health Paws is UNLIMITED – which helped us since ours was so high in vet/hospital bills. 
Overall, the price per month for Health Paws is SO minimal, I am sure that most spend more on Starbucks/Takeout than they would on the monthly cost of the insurance. Another thought as well – would you go without insurance for a human? I highly doubt that – and to me, this is the same for my dog. 
My claims were processed almost every time within 24 – 72 hours, with a check in hand almost immediately following. The customer support team as well throughout the past 3 weeks of everything they have even sent personal emails checking in on him! I only wish my doctor was as kind as them :) 
Again, if you are hesitating on signing up for Healthy Paws, please PLEASE take a deeper look at their minimal costs per month, extremely low deductible once you submit your first claim, and the comfort of knowing that if for some reason anything did go wrong with your pet, you are reimbursed anywhere from 70-90% of that cost, depending on the plan you choose!

I'm fortunate to say I'm not one of the customers who encountered crazy premium increases; if so, I'd likely feel different... however, the business of insurance in itself can easily turn messy - things don't go your way and your entire world is turned upside down.  For me, I happened to pick the right company at the right time for my cat who was afflicted with gastroentestinal issues chronically starting about 6 months after establishing our relationship with Healthy Paws.  Not once did I ever run into a single solitary issue when it came time to get reimbursed for her qualified medical expenses, and we went to the vet ALOT.  So often there were times I called apologizing for the volume of claims I was submitting at once, afraid I'd be denied just because I started getting self conscious.  
Their customer service is unparalleled, notably so when it comes to calling in with questions/concerns, clarification.  I was always treated with warmth, kindness, respect.  Where they fall short?  Communication.  At times it was maddening how often they needed the same thing over and over again because of incomplete records or something, something seemingly more prevalent of recent times.  Often it was like there was a lack of note taking between customer service reps so information I'd call in with sometimes wouldn't get processed and create confusion.  This occurred with my second pet whom I went through the appeals process with and eventually just walked away from in the end (fighting the claim, not my pet).  Perhaps Covid-19 times have brought about these instances/experiences of mine.  Importantly though, my cat passed last week and Healthy Paws has been more compassionate and comforting towards me than my own veterinarian.  That's not an exaggeration.  To me that's tremendous.

Murphy is the first dog I've insured with Healthy Paws and they are by far the best.  The claims handling process is super simple, they pay very promptly and customer service is very helpful.  Murphy just had both of his elbows operated on and I wasn't sure if everything would be covered so I called for some guidance.  Although they can't guarantee coverage, they will explain what categories of treatment won't be covered.  For example, treatment considered experimental like stem cell shots is not covered.  Frankly, I was surprised at the breadth of the rehab they do cover.  I also think that the unlimited dollar amount of claims is hugely important.  

I could not have afforded all of the treatment Murphy requires without the policy (his elbow surgery and treatment will end up costing about $7K).  Luckily, I have 90% reimbursement.  Although it costs a little bit more in premiums, Healthy Paws reimburses me more each month than I pay in premiums because Murphy also developed allergies and is on monthly meds that are expensive.  Sometimes I even feel a little guilty submitting claims because they have paid so much more than my premiums.

I’ll put my premiums away in case I need them   This is a copy of an email I wrote in response to my notice of my policies increasing more than 30 percent  which I got no response back . They just don’t care. I insured two akc puppies and instead of waiting for the younger puppy who is 6 months old anniversary date her premium was raised too and they made both dogs anniversary date the same. When speaking to customer service the only suggestion offered was lowering the percentage split so my premium was lower. See below for the rate new rate that was offered for renewal. This is my response:
I am very disappointed in the  30 percent plus increase in premium for my  puppies who are 6 months and one year old. I followed all the rules, waiting periods etc, everything you require .  I don’t know what kind of clients your company is Insuring to charge this much of an increase but it is not fair to parents who have brand new puppies with no health problems and no claims .  I feel that I have wasted my money and will be cancelling my account.   I expected a rate increase but not  over 30 percent, and did not expect it to include a six month old puppy. When I called customer service I was told your company was paying out more than you were getting for premiums. Sounds like your company needs to rethink something. Your going to lose all the revenue from the clients who have no claims for several years because they have young dogs for ones who have a multitude of issues. If this increase continues  my premiums could be more than double by the time they are 4 years old. I hope you pass this on to the administration that makes these decisions, because I’m sure I’m not the only one who is going to cancel.  I did not make this decision lightly and did my research before doing so. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED.....

Claims are easy to fill and they are extremely fast too reimburse. Most recently we had an emergency situation with my bulldog came out of her normal boarding with trouble breathing. It got worse and worse throughout the day and I had to bring her to the ER. They immediately sedated her and gave me feedback that she needed emergency surgery and might not make it. In addition to that, they told me she was the most critical animal at the hospital and if I hadn't brought her in within the hour she probably would not have made it. It was a lot of money to go through this emergency surgery and the hospital needed about $2,500 right away to keep her going through the night. I gladly paid it and had the confidence that Healthy Paws would cover and reimburse me the 90% I had signed up for. I called them the next day after receiving the full estimate which was about $13,000. Health Paws jumped on the phone with me and went through all of the details directly with the animal hospital. They took care of the entire situation so that I didn't have to worry about anything. The surgery was a success, and we got Clementine home after a few days. When I called Healthy Paws to make sure everything worked out, I realized that not only had the hospital been paid in full, but they had also reimbursed me the money I overpaid originally on that night. They saved my dogs life. I signed up my second dog (Dakota) the minute we got her. There aren't many companies out there that I ""love"".

Each year for the last three years our premiums have skyrocketed although we have little to no claims. In fact it went up 30% this year, this is for a six year old dog with no health conditions that has been insured by healthy paws since he was four months old!!!  In fact the letter of renewal came and indicated as if it was a badge of honor that they will never raise your rates more than 30% a year. Really? 30% a year, that means to you that every three years you can expect your premium to double. This should be extortion and we recommend going to another provider that won't rip you off this way. 

We have gotten six other pet owners from the dogpark to purchase healthy paws but no more, in fact one of them started out at $32.00 a month and in one year the new premium is $38.00.  This is with no claims on a dog that just turned two. Healthy paws used to be the best, little adjustments each year now they are telling policy holders they will never go up by more than 30% a year. Really? So in three years they can have the policy go up almost 100% so they can make more money. Other pet insurance is better, with regard to increasing the rate like this. When this was originally healthy paws foundation (before it sold about five years ago) this was never an issue. So if you are paying $35.00 (if that is what they quote you, be aware that in three years that $35.00 can be $100!!!).  In six years you now could be paying $200 a month, for pet insurance, what?   Who can increase premiums 30% a year with no claims what the heck?

We are looking for new insurance, last year we went from $35.00 to $47.00 and this year from $51.00 to now $69.00 a month!  Yet they tell us they can't go up more than 30% a year, they did when they raised my rates!!! It is insane, so be wary that they will likely stick it to you as well.

My suggestion avoid at all costs, if you have them get another plan as if your have a health crisis in your dog, know that other pet plans probably won't cover your dog. So get your dog in another plan so you can also save your hard earned money!!!!

I have been a loyal customer since 2012, insuring my 3 dogs for nearly $300/per month. I have been escalating a claim on a very painful ACCIDENT my dog sustained that knocked two teeth nearly out of his jaw. However, Healthy Paws continues to DENY the claim saying the tooth extractions that were necessary so my dog did not have to walk around with his two front teeth literally dangling by the nerves from his gums WAS ELECTIVE DENTISTRY. Monstrous treatment of a customer. The claim is 70% of $2300. After paying them nearly $30,000 over the past 8 years, I would not expect them to deny a claim for an ACCIDENT. That's the ENTIRE POINT of having insurance. Healthy Paws does NOT care about the health of your pet. They care about their profits. I am actually SHOCKED I paid this much over the years for such terrible service!

Interesting follow-up: After going back and forth with Healthy Paws for 4 encounters (you HAVE to keep at it or they hope you will just lose hope and patience and then simply go away), they have now UPPED my monthly premium because one of the reports from this dental visit listed my dog as a Wheaten Terrier (which is ONE of his breeds, most likely, but he is CLEARLY a mixed breed - most likely part Wheaten, part Mini Poodle, part West Highland terrier), and so now they want to reclassify him as purebred to gather a higher monthly premium. I have been asked to bother my vet (who has better things to do, like treat and save animals' lives), to send them a letter stating that he is a MIXED BREED, not purebred. They are determined to get my money one way or another. This will be the last pets I ever insure.

603ed9c8f85d7509f86a8b63,False,False,"We’ve had Healthy Paws for the last 7 years. We adopted our dog when he was 2 years old. We decided to get pet insurance in case of any surgeries, emergencies or cancer. We wanted to make sure costs wouldn’t keep us from getting our boy the best care possible. He was about 5 when we got him enrolled. Monthly costs ranged from approximately $30-60 the first 5 years and then went from $70-90 the last two years. I think the increase is fair since the policy is aging as well as the pet. For the first 6 years we never met our deductible ($250/80%). Our dog has chronic ulcers and we paid everything out of pocket. Exam fees are not covered. Fast forward and our dog is 12 years old and we are faced with stage 4 nasal cancer. Prior to the diagnosis we were seeing the vet left and right and then oncologists and quickly met our deductible. We got our first claim very quickly and then signed up for direct deposit right into our account. We decided since we had insurance and had done extensive research, to travel out of state for SRT/SRS radiation. I would say total for this cancer journey we have paid approximately $13,000 and have received roughly $10,000 back. We truly believe Healthy Paws is totally worth the investment and are happy to report the radiation treatment went extremely well and our dog is doing great! Healthy Paws even followed up with us via email to see how our baby was doing. Their customer service is top notch. I’ve sent many emails throughout the years with questions and they are always so pleasant and helpful. We recommend them to everyone. There are a lot of choices out there. Make sure you research and understand what is covered and what’s not. The most heartbreaking decision is not whether to say goodbye to a beloved pet, but whether money is the deciding factor.

My sister in law had just gone through a very tough medical experience with her pug and Healthy Paws covered over $9,000 worth of costs. That convinced us to get pet insurance. Number one dog proved to meet deductible just about every year with *other* issues. When we adopted our second mutt, he was already two and a large breed. We immediately purchased insurance through Healthy Paws for him as well. As in years prior, this year, it REALLY helped! To date, within this year's covered period, Clifford has exceeded $17,500 in vet bills for cancer removal and for repairing his Achilles tendon on both back hocks. We received over $15,000 in reimbursements. He is just about healed from his surgeries and should have physical therapy afterwards. Without pet insurance, I don't know many who could afford to properly take care of a dog like ours. The covered year isn't done, and we know we'll need more. I've only had one issue, and the issue was my lack of understanding. The customer service rep responded quickly and helped explain the issue. It was resolved within a couple of days.

A policy with Healthy Paws makes it easy for pet owners to focus on caring for their pets and getting them the treatment they need whenever they need it, without being overly concerned about cost. In many ways, I wish human health insurance were so simple and transparent. ;-)

Many years ago we purchased our first pet insurance coverage with another company (Pets Best): that coverage was inexpensive and seemed like it would be quite useful in limiting costs while providing incentives for regular checkups. While it was helpful in offsetting costs for smaller incidents, as our dogs aged we quickly found that the policy had payout maximums and ""separate occurrence"" definitions that limited their coverage quite sharply. We soon re-evaluated our options for insurance coverage and made the switch to Healthy Paws.

Whenever the unexpected has happened, we've been able to rely on Healthy Paws to provide consistent, understandable coverage for our pets. Most recently, one of our pets contracted a urinary infection while on vacation, which required a trip to an emergency clinic for treatment. We knew that whatever treatment she needed, it would be covered - and it was! :-) The broad coverage and clear policies have consistently covered various needs for our dogs, spanning knee surgery, upset stomachs, and broken nails; with no claim or lifetime maximums to worry about, there's no concern about ""exhausting"" the coverage or having to make financial decisions about the well-being of a pet.

The claim process is extremely easy with their website: upload an itemized receipt and they take care of the rest. There's occasionally a follow-up question or two - which is easy to answer - and they follow up with the veterinary clinic, typically completing the claim and sending the reimbursement within a few days.

6032976cf85d7509d8dfed58,False,False,"I had been a satisfied customer since 2013. The claims process was straightforward, the coverage was great, etc. My rates went up annually, which I expected, and the notices and FAQs said is based on the rising costs of veterinary care. Back in 2013 my monthly premium for two dogs was $63, with a $250 deductible for each dog.

In 2019 I doubled my deductible to lower my monthly premium and keep it under $100/month. 

In 2020 I got a notice that my monthly premium was increasing by 30%, and this year I received a notice that my premiums were increasing another 50%. My monthly premium will now be $194, over 3x more than when I signed up—and I have a higher deductible.

I’ve since learned that though they don’t come out and say it, they factor your pet’s age into their anniversary increases even if you signed them up when they were young. Once your dogs are seniors and likely have various health conditions, it is not easy to switch insurers because of their age and all of the conditions that would become “preexisting” with a new provider. So you’re stuck.

If you’re shopping for pet insurance, there is at least one competitor to Healthy Paws that bases premiums on your pet’s age at the time you enroll and doesn’t do “birthday increases.” I only chose Healthy Paws because their misleading language suggested they were the same. After doing some research I’ve learned that there was actually a class action lawsuit against Healthy Paws over this issue, and Healthy Paws does base the increases on your pet’s age.

Loyal customers who have paid premiums for many years on young, healthy dogs should not get stuck with thousands of dollars a year in premiums and high deductibles once their dogs age. They shouldn’t be forced to consider dropping coverage at exactly the time their dogs need it most.

I now have two of my dogs on Healthy Paws insurance; Milton my Bullmastiff and Cooper my rescue German Shepherd.  It is by far the best puppy insurance on the market.

I decided to go ahead with the policy and I never regretted that decision. For the first few years, my dog luckily remained healthy and I didn’t have to submit any claims. His rate increased every year but I understood that as he got older, there was an increased chance that I would need to submit claims. This past year I got the worst news ever- my baby was diagnosed with osteosarcoma. This is a quick death sentence for many pups. His vet gave him maybe 2 months left. Because we had Healthy Paws, I was able to aggressively fight this disease using the latest technology. There would be no way I would have been able to afford all of his tests and treatments without them (over $10,000).

One day, Pippa limped unexpectedly and went lame on her back leg and was in sharp pain and distress. it was a Sunday. Always happens. So off to the emergency vet. X-rays, pain meds and a diagnosis: broken ankle needing emergency orthopedic surgery. Cost $6000. I called Healthy Paws to verify my coverage, which they did. With little financial worry, I could focus on Pippa and her surgery and treatment plan. I received my invoices and sent them over to Healthy Paws along with my pups limited vet records. Less than a week later the claim was settled and less than two weeks later, the correct reimbursement is in my hand. And my Pippa is still in her cast because  the whole process start to finish at Healthy Paws took less than 2 weeks. The only major drawbacks that I find to the coverage is no coverage for office visits. No 90/10 plan coverage. No optional wellness plan. 
But to their credit they offer unlimited lifetime benefits. That’s what drew me to choose Healthy Paws. A catastrophic illness like cancer or kidney disease will eat up a $10k annual maximum in as little as 30 days. I know. I was there. So, when I looked around this was a priority.

Our story began last year when we adopted a puppy; our little Humphrey came from a very good breeder with a good family health history; did it matter?...not in this case and like people, things can go wrong sometimes health wise even at a young age. He was diagnosed with something similar to Crohn’s Disease (in humans) but in order to find this out, we ended up having to go through a process of elimination of a series of very expensive tests; from x-rays, to an ultrasound, to an endoscopic procedure with biopsies.

Healthy Paws was with us every step of the way, starting with the hassle free and ease of submitting claims, no questions asked and no bad surprises; “what we were insured for, is what we got”.  Each time, the claims were reviewed quickly; and the reimbursements received promptly. Their website is also very user friendly and the information provided very clear; their live Customer Service Agents, all excellent. 

Finally, I would like to add, that, as if this is not satisfactory enough, after each procedure that was done on Humphrey, Healthy Paws would follow up to see if he was feeling better...asking us to take care of him and not to worry about the rest! ...come on!... does your doctor’s office or health insurance company do that? 

It is as simple as that:  if Healthy Paws could insure us, humans, we would switch instantly!

I can tell you that Healthy Paws has been fantastic throughout this journey. Having pet insurance has really helped.

Insurance is not a fun thing to pay for on a monthly basis when you aren't using your insurance on a regular basis.  All it takes is one trip to the vet ER for you to realize what a smart idea it was to buy pet insurance.  Health Paws offers a VERY reasonable monthly premium for excellent coverage.  Unfortunately, my 3-year-old cat recently swallowed something and needed to have emergency surgery to remove a foreign object from his intestines.  No one wants to think about whether they can afford the treatment that is necessary to save their pet's life.  For that reason, I am so grateful I signed up for pet insurance through Health Paws.  The claim submission process was SO EASY.  I just submitted my invoice from the vet ER and Healthy Paws gathered the information and documentation they needed from the provider, and I got my reimbursement check days later.  I honestly could not be happier with Healthy Paws!",5,Couldn't be happier!,1,,2021-01-25T20:53:41.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=66
600e35cb755dc104c0c7ed39,False,False,"Healthy Paws has been by far the best insurance purchase I have ever made. As a multiple pet parent, having Healthy Paws on my side puts my mind at ease that any healthy issue my pups face will be handled and I can just focus on taking care of my pups. I have been a Healthy Paws customer since I first learned about them from a coworker. While primarily my claims have been for relatively minor items (torn dew claw, allergies, etc), the first time I truly saw the value and compassion was when my larger pup Montana injured his right stifle joint. Worried that he had torn his CCL, we apprehensively took him in to our regular vet to get a diagnosis. As expected we were referred to a Orthopedic Vet and our worst fears were confirmed when they said he needed surgery for a luxating patella and possible torn CCL. The consult resulted in a surgical estimate of $5515 at the high end, this is after imaging to confirm no major fractures. While not a small amount it was certainly within our means. 

What Healthy Paws did first was make sure I was concerned with my pups pre and post-operative care. They concisely informed me what requirements were for medical documentation and invoices and the process to provide that is super easy through their web app. They then made the process even easier when they approved the claim for all of Montana's veterinary, imaging, and surgical bills in less than 48 hours and had the re-imbursement direct deposited into my checking account in total less than 72 hours from me submitting the documents through the web app portal. 

What Healthy Paws is, an example of an organization that whose primary focus is their customers; the pets they insure, and their owners, the people who derive peace of mind from this coverage. They recognize their existence is to pay for pet's medical needs, not to deny claims to benefit shareholders like other corporate insurance entities. If the world had more organizations that acted like Healthy Paws, then we would live in a significantly different world. I will continue to espouse the values and virtue of Health Paws to all who are interested and have already done so with multiple individuals.

There was no pushback whatsoever, no repeated requests for additional documentation, and no questions about his treatment. I cannot say enough about this company, or its people.

I am currently paying $65ish, and the new quote is $35ish.

The entire industry does this because they want you to think their insurance is cheap, then drop them after a few years before you have any major claims... it is a classic bait and switch that I wish were better regulated.

I landed on Healthy Paws and could not be happier with my decision. 

When I took Ziggy home, I would never be able to predict anything so scary would happen. She’s happy, healthy, goes to her regular vet appointments and has a very active lifestyle. She has never been left alone for more than one hour; she goes everywhere with me except places she’s not allowed or places she’s been and doesn’t like. She’s the boss! 

The night of December 5, 2020 into the early morning hours of December 6, 2020 was the scariest moments to date being a dog mom. Ziggy began vomiting and pooping dark, deep, heavy blood. I brought her into the animal hospital where she was admitted into ICU and stayed for 2 days. Her vet continued to treat her on an outpatient basis the rest of the week to get Ziggy to the point of stable. Not once did I think about money, if I need to move with my parents to pay for her care, that’s what would happen. I am willing to do anything for my baby, including donating my limb if it helped her.

Whatever she needed, we did.  They were quick to process claims and send out checks.  So, when we rescued a new puppy, we got healthy paws right away.  It has already helped us tremendously with unexpected issues.  I tell all my friends with pets to strongly consider healthy paws!!  I worked in reception at a veterinary hospital for 4 years and saw the bills that piled up for dogs and cats having accidents, needing hospitalization, or long term management of a newly diagnosed issue.

5fd1867d755dc107e0bdc834,False,False,"When we adopted our rescue Skeeter I knew I wanted pet insurance. Prior to adopting Skeeter, we had adopted an English Bulldog and we passed up health insurance on him because of the cost. That was a huge mistake. There is nothing worse than having to make hard choices about your pets health because of the cost. Of course we always did what was necessary to provide our Bull Dog with the care he needed but it hurt us financially. 
For Skeeter I researched almost all of the pet insurance plans out there and after reading Healthy Paws policy, we decided that was the right plan for us. For the first 1.5 years our minimal claims never met the deductible, so there was no payment to us. 
Then this past Sunday my dog became very ill and was vomiting blood and passing blood through his feces. He’s had some digestive issues in the past but nothing like this. Monday I called my vet and they recommended the ER and advised he may need an x-ray or ultrasound. 
That night I filed a claim and today (2 days later) I received an email that the claim was approved. What a relief to have Healthy Paws there for us in such a scary time. 
Many of the negative complaints on here are no fault of Healthy Paws but rather the policy owner not understanding the policy. As the consumer it is your responsibility to know and understand what you are buying. I thoroughly read the policy and all the information related to how to file a claim and have never had an issue. 
The major items to outline is that on your first claim you must send in a complete history of your pets medical records so they can determine pre-existing conditions. Exams are not covered and you have to meet the deductible before benefits are paid. One you meet the deductible it’s a coinsurance percentage that you chose upon purchase. Hope this helps!

5fc425705e693f08f00e3733,False,False,"The claims process with healthypaws has become completely ridiculous!  I used healthypaws for years with my previous dog and they were wonderful but unfortunately a lot has changed in the last 8-9 months.  I always like to have insurance for my dogs and when I got two new puppies, early 2020 it was a no brainer for me to get healthypaws for them on day one.  Unfortunately, that was poor decision!  They now reject every and all claims you send them, telling you “additional action” is required to complete the claim.  They will send you an email with some BS like something is cut off or missing from the claim and you need to resubmit the information. They have done this with EVERY claim I’ve sent in!!! EVERY ONE!  Here’s the funny thing, this never happened once the entire time I used them before, Ive very familiar with claim filing process. I’m guessing they are now underwritten by a new company or just decided to be difficult so people would give up on filing a claim after three submissions.  They love to use the “page was cut off” excuse! Really.... I find that interesting as I take a picture of the page and the entire thing is in the image and nothing is mission or “cut off” as they like to say.  Ive send multiple responses and asked for someone to detail to me what the infraction is on a claim and you guessed it never once have I received a response. Back a year ago I would have said hands down go with healthypaws and dont even bother shopping around but seeing as they are no better now then any other insurance company, as far as customer service and claims processing, you might as well go with a cheaper company... I know I’ll be switching myself.

In response to your reply, it’s pretty clear my issue was ignored. You’re making a point to detail past medical issues, why? My dogs are puppies as I mentioned and don’t have any past issues or medical records. Furthermore, my issue is not with one claim. Every single claim submitted gets an action required email and then you give some BS reason like the claim is missing information or the page is cut off. The page can’t be cut off when it’s a picture of the invoice and I used the app and then camera to take the photo... I didn’t send some cut off fax, they are full page edge to edge images with all information clearly shown in the picture, for all claims submitted not just one. Your response just proves my point and shows the lack of customer support, now you want me to post my account information online??? Really, that’s a brilliant suggestion. I’ve sent multiple responses already via email and have yet to get a email response or phone call as I’ve requested, how about you take the time and care to respond to those and not just the complaints posted online.",1,Awful claims process,1,,2020-11-29T22:49:20.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=72

5fc00be65e693f0b10027f81,False,False,"We have two rescue puppers that both came from a bad situation.  They are now 7½ years old 5½, we foster-failed them when they were both very young, weeks old. We immediately got pet insurance when we adopted them.  We first used PetFirst, because I was attracted to the wellness package, but I was not very happy with the coverage.  Within a year we switched to Healthy Paws because I liked their coverage better, read excellent reviews, and realized that we needed insurance for life changing events (sickness and/or accidents).  We wanted peace of mind that if something should happen to our little furry family members, that it would be a choice of “will this give them the best quality of life?” as opposed to “can we afford this?”.  I tell you; the last two years have been a ringer for us, and we have never needed this insurance more. 

Our older pup was bitten by a rattlesnake, got a really bad MRSA infection that took a year to recover from and when we moved into our new home, he developed grass allergies (of all things?!).  He’s currently being treated by a dermatologist for that allergy and we are diligently working on redoing our landscaping and ripping out the grass…all for him.  Outside of the deductible and some small exclusions (i.e. exam fees) all of his vet bills were covered by Healthy Paws, we opted for the 90% reimbursement option years ago and have maintained that coverage.

Our younger pup ripped a nail completely off, but interesting enough the quick remained (very painful as it was completely exposed).  And then unfortunately, 3 weeks ago she was hit by a car and had to have a total hip replacement.  She also cracked a tooth in the accident that still needs to be addressed once she is stronger from her above operation.  We were there when it happened, saw it, and I can’t even begin to explain how we were feeling, seeing her almost killed, her suffering, and knowing that we failed to keep her safe.  That she is alive and will be ok, has kept us sane.  She was IMMEDIATLEY taken to a vet, stabilized, and treated for her injuries.  As terrifying as this all was, at no time did we think about the cost or that we will have to surrender her, let her suffer in pain, or euthanize her.  I lost 3 family members and my job this year.  The thought of not having her treated never even crossed our minds.  

All of this is thanks to Healthy Paws.  In the craziness of 2020, I am so thankfully that we had the insight to get insurance and grateful that Healthy Paws has been so awesome.  

Their claim filing is a complete breeze, it takes less than 2 minutes if you have your vet email you the receipt and any necessary medical records.  If you have any questions, their customer service has been very responsive.  And their turn-around time for reimbursement is very quick, within days!

From the beginning I have told all of our pet parent friends that they need to get pet insurance.  Do your own research and get what works for you, but I am a strong advocate for this company. 
  
Stay safe and healthy!

On to the surgical consultant and resulting procedure (with an overnight hospital stay).

Healthy Paws has been nothing but amazing when we have submitted previous claims for his meds, etc. After his surgery I submitted the invoices and the reimbursement was promptly processed. That's not even the best part. The Claws & Paws Protector, Tim W., emailed me to ask how Georgie was going. I couldn't even believe that!

A friend suggested that I get pet insurance because veterinary care has become expensive.  She suggested the one she used, but I investigated a number of companies and chose Healthy Paws.  Bow has had multiple eye surgeries, multiple leg surgeries and she has now developed some sort of liver ailments.  Over a 5 year period, they have reimbursed me thousands of dollars.  You may choose different levels of reimbursement - I chose 70%.   They made it easy to file a claim by simply  posting a picture of the bill via a cell telephone app.  I have always fronted the bill and the reimbursement has never been more than 2 weeks and most often it's less than a week.  Many of the companies I investigated would have dropped Bow's coverage because they have upper limits of coverage.  I have always received my reimbursement promptly and with no questions from the company. I've been able to keep Bow because of this insurance.  I can't thank them enough.

5fb590f75e693f0a842b2215,False,False,"Lily became a part of our family at around 18mo of life, she was kind of a mess in many ways as she wasn't treated kindly before entering her foster home. Right away we knew this high energy and agile dog would need insurance. I searched many plans before deciding Healthy Paws would fit our needs best. We worked hard to buy quality food and keep her healthy so we didn't feel the need for a plan that covered routine visits at the expense of having an annual cap or outrageous prices. We opted to have the lowest deductible with the highest reimbursement rate as we assumed we would need it for something like a torn ACL or broken leg years down the road. We went years with only needing to file a claim or two for minor cuts that would require a stitch here and there from rough play. Two months ago we took Lily in to check her for what we thought were digestion issues, to our dismay that visit we saw x-rays that showed an enlarged heart and the vet found other abnormalities. She was waitlisted to see a cardiologist and about two weeks later she needed to be rushed in to see an ER Cardiologist as her lungs were filling with fluid and her health was suddenly suffering. After a 24hour stay, medications, fluids, and multiple kinds of imaging she was released with a CHF diagnosis and a list of structural abnormalities within the heart. Our lively and spunky dog was returned to us with a large bill and a very expensive list of medications. Within the past month we had spent a lot of time in and out of vet offices, had to apply for care credit, lost hours of sleep counting respiratory rates, started 5 new medications, and had emotional break downs, but the easiest and most comforting part of this experience has been working with Healthy Paws. Filing claims is a breeze (literally takes one minute) in between all the stressful phone calls and commuting to different vets and picking up my child from school. The wait times to reach customer service is almost non existent, they follow up, answer questions, and are extremely transparent in what they cover. We never once needed to resubmit claims or renegotiate covering a bill or medications (seriously, one prescription was $664). THEY ACTUALLY REMIBURESED 90% of everything the website says they will. They provide explanation of coverage with each bill and we got our payments direct deposited in less than a week. Without this insurance we wouldn't have been able to provide her with quality end of life care, especially not during these Covid times being a small business owner and a young family.

Healthy Paws has been extremely easy to work with and usually completes claims and reimburses us within 1-2 days of submission. We are now trying out immunotherapy on our dog to actually treat her allergies, and I don't think we'd even be able to consider that if we didn't have coverage through Healthy Paws.

About a year into insuring my pets, healthy paws has denied documentation for my cat who has had multiple full exams by the vet.

There is no basis for this denial that I can find as he has had blood work, his teeth checked, his ears cleaned and is up to date on his boosters. He has gone to multiple vets over the few years I’ve had him. Now, any claims I’ve filed are being denied because the exams are considered incomplete. The vets didn’t think so.

I have been using Healthy Paws since 2016 when the insurance company I had for my dog, Waylan wouldn't pay his claims after he was diagnosed with a rare platelet issue. I did some research on various insurance companies and found Healthy Paws to be the best. They not only took on all his claims going forward but paid them at 70% and didn't asked twice in regard to any other medical issues he had going forward. In July of this year Waylan passed away and I was so touched by the way Healthy Paws reached out to me not only via email but also with a sympathy card that truly showed they cared about my special little friend. In September of this year I was fortunate enough to be blessed and grateful once again that I have Healthy Paws as insurance for my furry cat friend, Julian. He became very sick and within a week ended up three days in the Urgent Care undergoing various tests and treatments to find out why his liver values were so high and to get to the bottom of why he wasn't eating. He recovered nicely while in Urgent Care and came out with a feeding tube but to my surprise and the doctors as well, he was eating on his own again three days after being released from the Urgent Care. The bill for his treatment was over $4200.00! Even without pet insurance I would have found a way to pay for his treatment but without missing a step Healthy Paws reviewed his treatment chart and medical records paying 90% of his bill +/- his exam, food and natural medicine treatments. They also followed up with me via email twice to make sure he was recovering and still responding to treatment.

I had previous experience with other pet insurance, and knew I needed something better than what I had used with previous pets, so I did some research.  It has been the best decision I have ever made.  Tiger Lily was healthy and happy for years.  Each year I would barely use the deductible. Maybe a couple of years there was a foxtail in her foot, or a gastro intestinal episode, and I would be glad I was able to submit a claim.  Then, as she got older she developed allergies--and Healthy Paws has made it possible to get her monthly medications, and then there was an episode that landed her in the emergency room with a sludgy gallbladder diagnosis-- but it was an expensive ER visit. It gave me peace of mind to know that my insurance would cover it. Then she was diagnosed with a heart murmur, and I was relieved to be able to get an echocardiogram to see exactly what is going on. She developed arthritis, and I was able to get x-rays to verify this, and get her monthly medications to ease her pain, so she can still go on her ""walkies"".  And recently she had an acute middle ear infection that wasn't immediately visible--my vet sent me to the doggy neurologist because she was acting like she had a stroke., but I had peace of mind knowing I had Healthy Paws to help me through this issue.  Eventually it was determined she needed a procedure, a surgery, to clear out the fluid build up in her middle ear with a specialist... All through out this distressing health issue, the one thing I didn't have to stress about was whether or not my insurance would cover it.  Without Healthy Paws, my special Tiger Lily would not have been able to receive the necessary medical care she needed. Healthy Paws does what they advertise, and they are there when you need them.

It was the third time I moved into a new place in 3 years and the two other times the exact same thing happened.

The very unhelpful and moody customer care agent just said that she did not know why the price change, that their system decides on prices and not them, therefore she could not do anything about it.  So I explained to her that if I simply went on their site and input my address as a new client, it was offered a monthly premium 20% cheaper than what I was paying. (Which does not seem fair that they value a 2-year client less than any new client).

I said that to the customer care agent, and she once again said “there is NOTHING I can do about that”.  So I asked her if maybe I should just cancel my account and open a new one. I asked her if it wouldn’t just be smarter if I did that. She replies that it is up to me and then asked if she could process the cancelation.

The cancelation was processed and the following day I opened a new account with them for both my pets for 20% less.

5f94c088798e6f0aa0adc0f8,False,False,"I do not have enough positive things to say about my experience with Healthy Paws! Seriously, just get it.  Despite some teasing from friends about enrolling in pet insurance (I heard a lot of ""its just a cat, it'll be fine""), I figured it was a good thing to do when I got my two kittens, Loki and Bo, about 4 years ago. I did my research, and the reviews I found online indicated that Healthy Paws seemed to be the one people liked the most. That, combined with the affordable monthly fee and low deductible meant that it wasn't going to break the bank, even if my cats never needed it. I've owned cats my whole life and have never had one with health problems, and the most time we'd ever spent at the vet was for occasional stomach issues etc. However, because I was a student at the time, I wanted to be sure that my little fur babies were covered if something were to happen.  While one of my cats (Loki) has been 100%  fine with no major incidents, Bo hasn't been as fortunate. He was diagnosed last year with feline asthma, and healthy paws has paid for  all of his medications (score one for Healthy Paws). Recently, in what was a freak accidently, Bo slipped off a shelf and broke his back leg upon landing. I have never had a cat with this sort of injury, and was so anxious about the whole thing. The surgery to repair it along with the diagnostics etc cost about $10,500 dollars. I can say for certain, without Healthy Paws covering almost all of it, I might have had to put Bo down. The situation was so stressful, but the one thing I did NOT stress about was whether I could afford Bo's medical treatment. It was a huge relief to listen to the emergency vets and authorize various pain medications, hospitalization, and surgery without worrying as much about the financial side of things.  It also was a relief to the vet/surgeons, as I could tell they really thought surgery was the only way forward. I called the customer support worried about everything, and the guy I spoke to was so kind, respectful, and reassuring about the coverage I had to treat the cat. The reimbursements are quick, can be done via direct deposit, and claims are processed so fast. After the surgery, healthy paws sent me a follow up email making sure Bo was ok. I have never once felt  unsure whether or not Bo would be covered. In summary, if you have a pet, please get pet insurance even if you don't think you'll need it, or have never had an issue with an animal before. I never ever expected to be in the sort of situation I was in, and I'm not sure what I would have done if I didn't have Healthy Paws. I know other people with Trupanion and some of the other competition, and they have all agreed that my coverage is way more expansive.

We think he may have gotten hit in the eye while chasing after a tennis ball (his favorite activity)! Following a week of antibiotic treatment, his ulcer did not heal, and his regular vet performed a grid keratotomy. Another week or so of antibiotic treatment following this procedure and unfortunately, while his ulcer was healing in diameter, it was getting much deeper and turned into what is called a Descemetocele (a surgical emergency that requires immediate attention to save the eye). Finn was seen by an Ophthalmologist at a renowned local Specialty Veterinary Center and luckily, following an emergency conjunctival pedicle graft, his eye was saved and is now healing wonderfully. ALL of these visits and procedures were covered by Finn’s plan with Healthy Paws (aside from office visits and the remaining 10% that is not reimbursed with our 90% reimbursement plan). This was in the thousands of dollars… all because of a tennis ball!

I wish we could say that this was Finn’s one and only large insurance claim with Healthy Paws, but they also covered a major tooth fracture surgery that he had a few years back.

This insurance not only raise their rates without notifying their clients, but they will also treat you like a crook. I've never had to use our pet insurance the past 4 years since our family pets are well taken care of and healthy, so as long as you don't use it everything is ok... just don't you ever dare to need it. One of our dogs just recently had to go to the vet and has had to go to a specialist as well, so they've decided to put a hold on our claims for over 3 weeks even thought I've called to confirm they have all his medical records and I've received confirmation they had; however, these claims are still on hold so I decided to call, the representative wasn't being too helpful so I requested to speak with a supervisor. She transferred me to someone who claimed to be ""John senior manager for the Phoenix office"". This person was so passive aggressive and so far from being compassionate that I cannot believe I've been paying all these years for this type of service. During our call he told me I was lying when I said we've only had one previous claim back in 2018 for this one pet. He insisted he needed to MAKE SURE this was not a condition that he's had before 2016. If a dog has had a health condition for the last 4 years, how come I would be submitting a claim just now? What this company is asking for is borderline impossible to achieve, making it easy for them to decline claims. How can any vet have records for over 4 years? This person is making everyone in our pet's history work overtime trying to find files that are in storage, in boxes and that they will have to make a staff member walk away from attending clients, so they can show my dog has been healthy all these years, hence NO claims. I noted to John from the Phoenix office that once we submitted our first claim back in 2018, as their policy states, they should have received all his medical history which I'm sure they received in order to process that first claim in 2018, if not then THEY are not doing their due diligence, as any new member needs to provide a complete medical history. This person was not only trying to make a situation worse claiming that I was lying because my first claims were submitted in 2020 (not true), he was trying to prove HIS case that I was lying when I said we have submitted other claims in the past. Healthy Paws claims to have compassion once your pet is going through a situation; however, they have done the complete opposite. I am beyond disappointed this is how Healthy Paws treats pet owners when they need to use the services they are paying for,  even when they raise their rates with no real fundamental reason, during COVID-19 when so many people have lost their jobs, and treat poorly the ones that can still afford to pay their high rates.",1,A Company that tries hard to prove you're a liar,2,,2020-10-12T19:16:01.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=78

Their claim process is horrible it can take up to 30 days to get reimbursement. They also lost a class action suit in Washington where they were ordered to pay customers millions due to raising rates because of dogs getting older. They're much better insurance companies out there do your research this is a shady insurance company that doesn't care about your pets just about money. The pathetic thing is the responses they're giving to everyone leaving negative reviews on here acting as if they care. Quit acting like you care and do something about your scummy practice of raising rates to ridiculous amounts.

5f6645e302e8570a487623ea,False,False,"I am so happy that we got Healthy Paws pet insurance when our dog, Lyle, came into our lives a couple of years ago. She is a healthy 3-year old dachshund mix (probably terrier) that a little over a month ago ruptured a disc and consequently suffered severe spinal trauma that resulted in paralysis from the waist down. She had surgery two days after the trauma; together with the hospital stay, medications and other various expenses, it cost ca. $15,000. Healthy Paws not only paid 80% of that, but since then has reimbursed us for 80% of her (fairly expensive) rehabilitation. She sees a specialist in canine rehab 3x a week, who does massage therapy, exercises, acupuncture, laser therapy, vibration therapy and other assorted things at the cost of $220/session. It is worth every penny, but we in no way could’ve afforded Lyle’s surgery or rehab costs on our own and would’ve had to let her go. Now, a little more than one month after the surgery, Lyle has gone from being completely paralyzed from the waist down with no control over her rear legs, her bowels, or her bladder to being able to stand on her own and even to standing up on her own. The prognosis for her walking again is good! We have found the customer service representatives at Healthy Paws incredibly friendly, empathetic and helpful, and those in the Claims Department patient, responsive, and prompt in their reimbursements. All this is so important when one’s pet is in pain and you are trying to move as quickly as possible to get it the care it needs to improve chances of recovery. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Healthy Paws, as well as to the marvelous veterinarians Lyle has had and to Lyle herself, who is incredibly tenacious, stubborn and determined (sound familiar all you dachshund owners?).

As a new dog owner I immediately started to research pet insurance because I was unfamiliar with it and wasn’t sure if it was worthwhile.  After researching and comparing pet insurance I decided to invest in Healthy Paws.  I figured better safe than sorry.  Everything was fine until Milo was about 1 ½ years old and he started to have medical issues.  He had his veterinarian which lead to his animal ophthalmologist and eventually his neurologist.  It was finally determined the next course of medical action was to have an MRI and Spinal tap performed.  Without thinking, because you will do anything for your little furry family member, we went ahead with the costly procedure just to finally rule out a neurological issue.  We made this decision thinking we would have to pay for the procedure out of pocket.  When I finally took a look at the coverage Healthy Paws provided for Milo’s policy, it covered 80% of the procedure minus the deductible.  A good portion of the cost was covered by Healthy Paws, which was a financial relief, along with the relief of finding out Milo did not have a neurological issue.  Healthy Paws customer service was very friendly and great to work with and the claim submission process was very easy and once all the required medical records were submitted it only took a couple of weeks to receive the check in the mail.

5f5f7db702e8570a4871d6bb,False,False,"PET OWNER BEWARE!!!! If I could give Healthy Paws negative stars, I would. I used to LOVE Healthy Paws. I literally would recommend them to everyone I knew. I have a dog who was a very sick puppy. Without Healthy Paws, I would not have been able to keep her alive and I do thank them for all they have done to help me with her medical problems. As an insurance company- they are great. They reimburse medical bills easily and quickly. Their claims process is easy and straight forward. The reason I am writing this very negative review is because their rates are absolutely INSANE! They let you sign up for a very cheap rate- somewhere between $30 and $50 a month. After your first year and ANYTIME something changes (your address for example) they take that opportunity to INCREASE YOU RATE. Several times I have moved since getting Healthy Paws (some I changed states, some I just moved within the SAME state) and every single time the rates increased. I recently got an email in July 2020 stating that rates were going to increase and I would go from $49/month to $61/month. No one is ever happy with rate increases but an $12 increase wasn't that bad in my opinion. It was at that time that I also updated my address and SOMEHOW it made my rate go up to $68/month. Whatever, I was not happy with the increase but again, I sucked it up. This morning, I was checking my financial statements and noticed that my premium INCREASED TO $91/MONTH. Excuse me, what?! I was never notified of this increase and I certainly doubt that veterinary costs have increased this much since JULY 2020. I know what you are thinking- reviewer has a sick dog so her rates went up because of her number of claims. NOPE. I haven't filled a claim in over 2 years due to my dogs medical issues being taken care of. So why was my rate increased so much? The question remains unanswered. I will mention that a Class Action lawsuit was filed in Washington against Healthy Paws and they were fined and required to pay back people in Washington who had been using Healthy Paws for years.

One of my six cat-children gets chronic UTIs and is prescribed orbax and then acepromazine, amitriptyline, or valium 9usually valium because the results are immediately and he will go pee without straining or crying) to relax his urethra from spasm so he can pee. My doctor has written a note I have to send to HealthyPaws EVERY TIME he goes thru a UTI. Could the put it in my fiel? Heck yes. Do they? heck no! Being that it's chronic and ideopathic this is frequent, other than booster shots and checkups that is suually why he goes to the doctor. But because valium and amitriptyline are also used as ""behavioural"" drugs HP won't cover it without a struggle. What behaviour am I trying to alter other than a  blocked urethra that cost 550$ at the emergency vet (over an hour away) for overnight sedation and catherization then $300 at my regular vet for followup the next day? The kicker is the valium is a controlled substance so the doctor gives me only 8 pills (he takes half). It's FIVE FLIPPING DOLLARS. The ace is $7, and I get a month supply amitripyline for under $10. So they are just nickel and diming a covered expense. So a claim that is $0 for exam+60 for liquid orbax OR $30 for tablets+$5 for valium+$25 for onsior ($100~$130) VS blockage that would cost $850 <--cathertization only, not emegerncy surgery

Flash forward to a month and a half into owning my sweet new pup, and we suffered our first major freak accident. He wound up getting bounced from ER to vet to ultimately needing emergency eye surgery, and less than 24 hours later, we were faced with a $7,500 bill to save his poor little eye. Luckily I had opted in for the insurance when I first got him, and since our grace period was over, we qualified for the full coverage offered for such a sudden damaging accident. I wound up paying a fraction of what I would have, and was able to upload my bill invoices quickly and easily with their super intuitive app through my phone.

No forms to fill out, no questions. Within 10 days I had my check! I was floored. Then a week later my girl woke up vomiting blood. Back to the ER where they ran bloodwork and took an Xray. Nothing was found. All they could do was send her home with more meds and a special diet and hope the vomiting would stop. Thankfully, it did. Again, uploaded my vet bill and within one week I had my check. I cannot believe how easy it is.

It is highly recommended you get some type of pet insurance for your dog or cat. Yes, it is a monthly expense that is not cheap. Think of it as giving you peace of mind and hopefully you never have to use it.

My 4.5 year old dog was recently diagnosed with lymphoma and hearing this from our vet was gut-wrenching. We immediately took him to the oncologist who said it is treatable and then told us chemotherapy will cost over $10,000. We told the vet to do whatever it takes to get him healthy.

Having Healthy Paws Insurance gave us one less thing to worry about; i.e. the cost of the medical care for my dog. My dog is getting treated weekly and the bill is from $500 - $800 per week depending upon the treatment that week. Healthy Paws has never declined a claim. In fact, they even send me emails checking up and seeing how my dog is doing. 

Here is the process with Healthy Paws I go through to file my claims:

1) Each Thursday, my dog gets his chemotherapy treatment. Our vet then emails us the invoice and medical notes. I then file a claim on the Healthy Paws web site and upload the receipts which literally takes LESS THAN ONE MINUTE - it is a VERY easy and efficient process.

2) I immediately receive an acknowledgement email that it will be processed within (48) hours.

3) By Friday or Monday, I receive an email that the claim has been processed.

4) By Monday or Tuesday, the money is wired into my checking account.

I promise you I am not exaggerating. This is how quickly they process the claim and pay you back.

As I got older and more financially stable, I figured I wouldn't need pet insurance for any future pets.  But then my awesome Rhodesian Ridgeback, Banksy, got a freak bacterial infection of the liver at the age of 8, just a few weeks ago.  It was very sudden and he got sick fast and we took him to the emergency vet, where he ended up staying for 3 days.  His health was declining rapidly and the vet said that a biopsy of the liver would be the best course of action to try to identify what was wrong with him and give him the correct treatment.  As she was rattling off the options and costs, she said the surgery (best option) would be $12,000-$15,000.  In that moment my heart sank because it was so much money and we probably wouldn't make that choice.  But then I remembered I had pet insurance and it was a huge relief. We went forward with the surgery, but sadly the infection had gone too far and wasn't treatable.  We had to say goodbye to our Banksy dog very suddenly. One of the only things that gave me comfort during such a sad time was knowing that we did everything we could for him.  If we didn't have insurance, we wouldn't have been able to give him all of the options and I would have always been wondering if we could have done more.  His total bill was $16,000 and Healthy Paws covered 80%. It was super easy to file the claim, and the check was in the mail within a week.  I will always have Healthy Paws insurance from now on, in hopes that I will never need to use it.

He started attending puppy Pre-K at 10 weeks and eventually worked his way up and earned his AKC partner canine good citizen certificate at 8 months of age. Around his nine months mark however, he started limping.  I put him on crate rest and the limping got a little better and then a whole lot worse. I brought my baby beefcake in to see our vet.  Loki had a partial tear of his left acl and needed to have surgery that included  a plate and screws.  He was on crate rest for 12 weeks and then slowly started going on leash walks. Finally he was able to be a normal dog again and BAM he tore the acl in his right leg and once again needed surgery.  Without Healthy Paws I just don't know how I could have taken care of him and had both surgeries done. The surgeries and testing have totalled close to $9,000 so far.  Healthy Paws was there, and contknues to be there, to answer any questions I have.  They have taken care of processing each if Loki's claims within 24-48 hours. Loki's joint supplements have been covered as well.  The representatives at Healthy Paws have even sent messages checking on Loki to see how he's healing up. What insurance company does that?  They have helped to relieve so much worry and stress which has allowed me to focus on doing what I need to in order for my Loki to get well and get back to being the gentle playful big boy he is. Would I recommend them?? ABSOLUTELY ... and I have to friends, coworkers, family and strangers.

A few months after I adopted him, it became apparent that he had significant seasonal allergies and was started on allergy immunotherapy (not Cytopoint or steroids) but actual immunotherapy). Healthy Paws covered the testing, immunotherapy and medications at my initial 90/10 plan rate later I changed to the 80/20 plan.He had a “normal” annual physical exam in March of 2020 but in April he was diagnosed with a bleeding ulcer and IBD which is apparently similar to Crohn’s in humans. I can say that the cost of emergency care at a University small animal hospital, diagnostic workup, surgery and prolonged care including around the clock tube feedings and medications at home as well as local follow up visits/labs, chronic medications etc is enormous. And no one wants to be faced with the heart breaking decision to euthanize a pet/family member due to inability to pay for medical care. So far, Healthy Paws has continued to cover the expenses at my plan rate. It is extremely easy to submit a claim, just take a picture of the paid invoice and upload it to HP through their APP. The claims are handled in a timely manner and I have had no significant problems. Occasionally they will need “further documentation” and that can be obtained by having the institution send documentation to HP or I am able to send it by email.

Policies can start at $35+/month.
What they don't explain or state anywhere is how much that premium will increase year over year. How convenient.
In your second year your premium will increase 15%-20%. So factor that into your math when you look at getting the policy with them in the first place.

As others have stated they won't even notify you that this increase has taken place. You will just see that higher number charged to your card without warning.
My plan increased by 16% and this is only my second year with Healthy Paws.
Can't imagine how much it will increase next year.

Again, as I've read in other reviews here, when you ask them they will respond with a canned answer that the premium increase is because of the state you're in or that pet policies in general are ""getting more expensive.""
It's seriously a bunch of BS.
Just an excuse to steal your money.
Deceptive company who doesn't care about your pets. They just care about getting your money and tricking you.

They get you in on an ""affordable"" number/cost, then gauge you every year after that.

Here's an example of what this insurance would cost over a 10-year period, based on a premium of $51 (90% reimbursement), + an increase of 15%/year And that is likely on the very low end of what your actual increase will be.

Very shortly afterward, C.C. became so sick with vomiting, bleeding and appetite loss, and I remember saying to her, “Don’t worry, C.C. I’m not going to give up on you and we are going to figure out what is wrong and make you better.”  After numerous and expensive tests, she was diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and we were able to control the IBD and she was her beautiful happy self again.  

Then, in December 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer of the liver and spleen.  The vet gave me terrible news that typically even with treatment, most dogs with this type of cancer only live 4-6 months, and the treatments are $3k/month.  C.C. was only seven years old, and I was terrified of losing her.  Thanks to her Healthy Paws pet policy, I had the option to treat her with chemotherapy, otherwise, she would never have had this chance, and I would have had to put her down in January, 2019.  A year and a half later (which is a long time for a dog), C.C. is still with us and her cancer is in remission.  I would have never been able to afford the treatments on my own, but Healthy Paws made it possible to keep my promise to C.C. that I was not going to give up on her.  Additionally, taking the financial strain out of the stress of taking care of a sick pet was so incredibly helpful.  To date, Healthy Paws has paid all 108 of C.C.’s claims. (I also have another policy for C.C.’s brother, Pirate, but after 4 years, he still has no claims.  Good Dog!) 

Every once in a while, I get a little note from Healthy Paws asking how C.C. is doing, and I am so happy to report that she turned 9 in January and is still doing well.  I asked if I was in jeopardy of having our policy canceled, and the response was, “Nope! As long as you pay your premiums, we will keep paying the claims!”  Every claim I submit has been processed, and I usually have the money back in my account within a week.  C.C's oncologist also has a Healthy Paws policy for her dog.  She told me she tells other pet parents about C.C.'s good news story whenever they ask her opinion on purchasing pet insurance.

I thank God every day that C.C. is still with us, and I thank Healthy Paws for allowing me to afford the care of my pets.  The world is definitely a better place with them in it.",5,Thank God for Healthy Paws!,0,,2020-05-23T13:34:09.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=90

I should let you know, I am a 3 1/2 year old She-Puppy who is called BeePop a LuLu, BeeBop, Baby and many other terms of endearment.  

In my house, (and, YES!  It is MY house!) there is also a He-puppy. 

We are sighthounds.  

By nature, if we catch sight of an insect, we chase it; and naturally. . . want to devour it.  Mmmm. . . Yummy (I think, maybe.  Hmm, don't know really, just like catching things.)

One beautiful sunshiny summer day, I did just that!  I ate a bee right AFTER it stung me. (Yeah, I know.  Bees are good for the ecological system.  I get that.  Really, I do!) 

Unbeknownst  to me and my people, I am allergic to bees.  Immediately after the bee stung me, I cried out, vomited and had diarrhea simultaneously, and collapsed to the kitchen floor.  We made it to the Pet Emergency in under 15 minutes, with one calm and one ballistic humans carrying me into the Pet ER, my head lolling to the side with my eyes rolled back, and shallowly breathing.   I was diagnosed with anaphylactic shock due to bee sting. Thankfully, I recovered.  

Recently, my He-puppy (He is MY puppy!) broke his leg, which has been a devastating and traumatic experience for our entire household. He-puppy had to go to the Pet Emergency, too, and also had to have surgery on his leg.  Really scary stuff!

During both incidents, my humans paid the bills and later submitted the insurance claims on-line to Healthy Paws.  

The on-line claims process is streamlined, quick, and efficient; and, the entire claims process from beginning to end was completed within a few weeks.  

As a result of this efficiency, my people were able to focus on our recovery, rather than the additional anxiety of completing tons of forms and repeat follow-up conversations with customer service representatives.  

Truly, a blessing. 

In addition, our Paws & Claws Protectors had genuine concern for both of our health & recovery and communicated with my people especially about us.  Yep!  They know me by name, too.  Pretty Pawsome!

This made our people very happy.  

Some people on the planet do not understand fur babies are absorbed into their human family's pack as members. 

It is not a ""them"" and ""us,"" rather it is a ""WE"" and ""OUR FAMILY.""  The Healthy Paws and the Paws & Claws Protectors get it!  They understand we are essential members in our family -- OUR PACK!  Both He-puppy and I recommend Healthy Paws to other fur babies and their people.

Within a matter of 7-10 days (or even less) there is a resolution to your claim. Since the medical bill was far enough beyond my deductible, Healthy Paws  deducted that from my reimbursement, which of course is expected.

I have to say I am very disappointed that HealthyPaws decided to bump up my premiums, possibly in response to my filling the numerous claims. I input my pets' exact ages and breed information to get a quote, and it was $40 lower than what they are trying to charge me now. I tried browsing their website to see anything about premiums rising in response to claims, but the FAQ just has a generic 'premiums will rise due to advances in technology'. So I am sad to say they apparently do not reward customer loyalty in the slightest. Unfortunately my cat now has a pre-existing condition precluding her from finding new insurance, but I will be shopping around for my other pets and I simply cannot afford the premiums even set at the lower reimbursement percentage. I have sent them an email and expect some unhelpful platitudes in response.

Original:
I have Healthy Paws insurance for all 3 of my animals. Only last year did I have to actually file a claim, and since then I am not sure what I would have done without them. My cat went into heart failure and was diagnosed with a progressive heart disease requiring daily medications, blood work every 3 months, and repeat echocardiograms. None of that is cheap but it is necessary to give my cat the best chance at a comfortable life for as long as possible. 

I submitted my first claim after owning her for 4 years so there was a lot of medical records to go through. It took roughly a week to review and have my first claim approved, but the company kept in touch and kept me updated on the progress. I had to call once to clarify a discrepancy with the medical record but it was quickly cleared up. After that, it was so easy to take a picture of my invoices and submit a claim on my phone via the app. Reimbursement would arrive within days directly in my bank account.

5e8dedf3086b6409bc801ea9,False,False,"I got Healthy Paws for my puppy the day after I brought him home. The day after the waiting period was over, he got bloat at 3 months old (highly unusual). I definitely did not expect him to get bloat at such a young age (or have any health issues) and had considered waiting to put him on the insurance. Once I got the 6000+ vet bill I was over the moon I had gotten it. My plan was for 80% coverage (different options for this), so I had to pay my $250 deductible, the vet consultation (not covered but this usually is never a lot, $144 out of my $6000 bill), and 20% of the total bill. Very fair in my opinion. 


It took a few weeks for me to be reimbursed (I’ve heard it’s usually faster but I think with Covid-19 it might have taken some more time). Everyone was so nice, helpful and knew exactly what was going on each time I called. They received and reviewed my documents in a timely manner. 


I initially chose healthy paws because they cover all congenital and hereditary conditions (some insurances have limitations or charge more for that) and are affordable. I figured this was most important because you never know what might happen that would be deemed hereditary and could require a big surgery and then not be covered. 


I was hesitant to even get pet insurance because I know a lot of times you end up not needing it. I’ve read a lot of opinions saying you could just as easily set aside the monthly payment in savings and you’ll still have the money if you don’t need it. Accidents/surgeries can easily cost over $10k. In my case, I pay about $50 a month. It would take me ten YEARS to have saved up $6000 for my puppies surgery if I set aside $50 a month.

While at sea (with no wifi or internet), and Harry with a pet sitter, he ingested things he should not have while she was at work. After excessive vomiting and diarrhea, she contacted my daughter who rushed him to the vet, and then on to the vet hospital. After emergency surgery, the vet bills came to over $3,900.00.

I got home from the cruise to these insurmountable bills. 

I contacted Healthy Paws immediately, first through my app, and then via email.

I'm updating this review in response to the Healthy Paw reply to my original review. Their reply evades the entire well documented issue noted in my review and by numerous other reviews here and elsewhere, that Healthy Paws repeatedly loses/misplaces/ignores records submitted by policy holders. Instead of addressing this issue, Healthy Paws attempts to pass the buck and lay it on vet offices and pet owners. Hey Healthy Paws- re-read my review: I am clear that there was NO issue with records being released by the vet- the ONLY problem was YOUR company claiming non-receipt. 
Instead of doing damage control, how about just processing the records??

They reel you in, get you stuck, and then ignore you. My dog has been enrolled since 2017. Every year the premium increases. Every time I move, the premium increases. Yet Healthy Paws has cut their phone hours for claims (though not their phone hours for new enrollment), does not answer inquiries sent via their online system, and provides no direct email address to reach them.
The first year my dog was enrolled, Healthy Paws repeatedly claimed they had not received my dog's initial medical records, though my vet and I had both faxed and emailed the records multiple times. At one point a rep told me that they get so many faxes that they can't go through them all, so we were expected to keep sending the records until Healthy Paws got around to reading them. Unknown what they do with all the faxes they can't seem to review. Vet staff always roll their eyes when I tell them the insurance we have. Every vet office we've visited has stated they've heard of the problems with Healthy Paws, most prevalent being the company denying claims because they say they haven't received the animal's medical records. It doesn't matter if you fax them, email them, or upload them on the app, you will likely not hear anything from Healthy Paws on your claim until you call them to ask what is going on, at which point they'll probably say they never got the records. Refer them to the email/fax/upload, and they'll simply say it never came through.
The worst part is that once you sign up with them and make a claim, it is nearly impossible to switch insurance providers, as your animal will then have a ""pre-existing"" condition. Doesn't really matter the reason for the claim, insurance will still find some tenuous and medically improbable connection between a pet's former injury or illness and a future condition. Your dog broke a nail off when he was 6 months old? Well that respiratory infection he now has at age 8 is undoubtedly the result of a bacteria that entered his bloodstream through the nail cut 7.5 years ago...at least that's the logic used by insurance companies, including Healthy Paws.
Has Healthy Paws reimbursed me for some of my dog's medical claims? Yes. Would I recommend this company? Only if you have an animal that you think is likely to end up with some kind of major injury, and you can afford $50+ per month for the life of your pet, and know that monthly premium will increase every year and every time you change your address.
Keep in mind that they only cover a percentage of PROCEDURES, MEDICATIONS, and DIAGNOSTICS. And only AFTER your deductible is fully met. And the way they calculate that is by applying the deductible to the percentage of the initial claim they would have covered once the deductible is met. In other words, if you have 80% coverage and $250 deductible, and you go in for a procedure that is $500, including a $80 office visit, they first take off the $80 (not covered), then they apply the 80% coverage to the remaining $420 bill ($336), and THEN they apply the $250 deductible.  $336-250 - $86. That's right, of the $500 visit, you will get reimbursed $86. Sounds alot more like 20% coverage than 80% coverage, right?
The only way this pays for itself is if your animal has a BIG bill, or more than one major expense after the deductible is met.

5e5938853c93ae0864a9d7a7,False,False,"Do not recommend.  While employees are pleasant and claims process fairly smooth, Healthy Paws' definition of ""deductible"" is inconsistent with what one commonly associates with the term in the insurance industry.  They carefully define ""deductible"" in the policy to be the amount one must first pay AFTER your pet's coinsurance portion is applied"";  thus your out-of-pocket spend is not 100% counted towards the deductible amount.  For example, if you have if have a deductible of $750 with a reimbursement amount of 60%, in fact you must spend $1,250 ($750/.60) before reimbursement potentially kicks in.  They multiply the percentage of reimbursement times your out of pocket and consider that amount towards the deductible;  e.g., 60% x $1,000 (out of pocket) = $600 towards annual deductible.  There are no disclosures making this clear.  I never would have purchased the policy had this been more clear to me.  After submitting only two claims, they raised my rates.  Very questionable business practices.  I have since switched insurers with even better rates!",1,"Strongly do not recommend;  understand their calculation of ""deductible"" before purchasing.",2,,2020-02-28T15:57:57.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=95

We purchased our dream kitten from Russia, and we immediately had all the health checks done and obtained accident and illness insurance from Healthy Paws.  As they say, everything can change in an instant, our “Putin” was adorable and happy for the first several months, then started to slow down and finally was in the ER due to severe constipation. A week later he is hospitalized for a week and finally they sedated him and manually removed stool from his colon. It was a horrible process; and a hospital bill of over $5,000.00. Healthy Paws reviewed the claim in a matter of days and we had our reimbursement quickly! The claim process is quick an easy, just upload the information from your home computer to the website, attach a copy of the medical records history for the first claim, and if questions; they will contact you. 
     Unfortunately for us, the treatment was only a temporary fix, in a matter of weeks the problem was developing again, the Putin was referred to a surgeon to discuss options for surgery for Megacolon. The surgery would give our 10-month-old kitten a chance at a normal life, otherwise, it would just be repeated hospitalizations and removal of stool. Thanks to having Healthy Paws pet insurance, we were able to better afford the surgery that he needed. Putin was in hospital for a week, he had a subtotal colectomy, and a repair of a pericardial hernia, and his liver put back in place.

Then just when he turned 10 years old Healthy Paws sent a policy renewal notice that had a rate over 50% more than the year before! I called and asked and was told that it was because we moved (<10 minute drive from our old home but apparently changing zip codes was all it took.) I don't know why an indoor cat is going to suddenly change their health status because of their zip code, but I can only assume this was really because he had become a senior so they didn't want to cover him any more.

My suspicions were confirmed when I put a claim in for lab work they had always covered in the past, only to have the claim denied with no reimbursement. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me so I called and cancelled. Customer service made zero effort to try to keep me on-board. I'm giving them a star based on excellent service in years past, otherwise this would be a one star for a company that actively tries to drive customers away the moment their pets become more likely to have issues.

Edit to add after company response: They talk about trying to keep increases manageable, but all my previous annual rate increases were in the $1-3 range. This one was over $20/month to $64/month. At the new rate I would’ve been paying over $700/year just for the privilege of having insurance. There’s no way that makes any sort of economic sense for a pet owner.

I was lucky enough to have insured my beloved cat a few years ago. Mrs. Fat, as she is lovingly called due to her love of food and pleasantly plump appearance, came to me as a rescue in 2013 after being abandoned by former owners not just once, but twice and was found wandering the streets of a friend of mines neighborhood. From the moment I brought her into my home Fatness stole my heart. I went through a horrible divorce that involved abuse and Fatness has always been my touchstone, my true north. She is my family and I cannot imagine my life without her. Over the past few months Fatness blood work started showing some out of the ordinary readings and after being admitted to ICU right before Christmas, the team at Sugarland Veterinary Specialists expertly took care of her and fast-tracked her into surgery and biopsies to get the right diagnosis. Procedures I could never have afforded without Healthy Paws. I was frantic and besides myself with worry and grief and Healthy Paws not only made me feel safe and protected and that I could provide the love and care my pet so desperately needed. They even went above and beyond to help with direct pay on a moments notice as things were moving so fast and it was the week before Christmas. On Christmas Eve Fatness was diagnosed with Liver Disease. Although my heart is broken that my furry family member received this painful and eventually terminal diagnosis; through the continued help and support of Healthy Paws, she is being treated with a combination of home and hospital therapy and support and as I write this is lounging outside on her patio in the sun.

We had no idea that Healthy Paws would save Toro's life so young. We are forever grateful for their customer service team allowing us to just focus on Toro's recovery and not worry about the finances. It was very scary and stressful enough.

I am J Li and I am writing this review with so much angry to Health Paws.

My beloved dog named CICI, a 9 years old black Labrador retriever, she joined Health Paws pet insurance plan from Feb, 23,2018.(CICI Policy Number: 559705-3)

On July 11, 2019 CICI had acute onset tetraparesis, and I took CICI to VCA Desert Animal Hospital to see a doctor and hospital recorded CICI's every health information from 2017.

After examination, Dr. Caldwell suggested I took CICI to VCA Valley Animal Medical Center & Emergency Hospital.

After serval hours examination in VCA Valley Animal Medical Center & Emergency Hospital, Dr. Jennifer Kingsley told me that CICI need a surgery and referred CICI to Veterinary Neurology Center in Tustin, California.

My wife and I took CICI to Veterinary Neurology Center in Tustin, California on July 12, 2019. Dr. Philip Schissler performed a very successful surgery and we were able took CICI to back home on July 15,2019.

I submitted a claim for CICI's pet insurance on July 16, 2019, and I received email from Healthy Paws. It seemed everything was OK.

After serval days, I reviewed CICI's claim state on Healthy Paws website, and found there was an Action Needed for more documents. In the meantime, I didn't receive any email required such Action Needed from Health Paws.

I send the documents as required below of the three hospitals, quoted from the Healthy Paws' website: 
""Complete medical records for claim visit and previous visits, including veterinarian’s physical exam findings, laboratory results, and any other documentation associated with your visits. Your veterinary hospital will provide these documents to you and many are happy to send them on your behalf.""

I sent all of CICI's records received from the three hospitals to Health Paws via Healthy Paws website after I logged in my account.

Meanwhile I received a email for VCA Valley Animal Medical Center & Emergency Hospital, and I was told they had sent CICI's records as required to Healthy Paws directly on July 27,2019.

Yesterday (Aug. 17, 2019) I received a email form Healthy Paws which stated ""CICI's claim was closed due to missing documentation and length of time it had been open. At this time we still need Cici's full medical records prior to 7/11/19 submitted for us to review.""

However, when I checked CICI's claim state on Health Paws website, a new row shows there is no Action Needed, instead shows ""In Process"" and when I clicked in there is not requirement of any documents.

I had send CICI's records of VCA Desert Animal Hospital from Dec 8, 2017 to July 11, 2019 to Healthy Paws already on Aug 01, 2019 via Healthy Paws website.

5d1a356142fa560834bdfba2,False,False,"I wanted to take the time to write up a thorough review for Healthy Paws after a recent experience with my cat, Ava. I adopted Ava in January of 2018 as an 8 week old, healthy little kitten. While I had been wanting to adopt an older kitty, I thought that by adopting a younger one that I could perhaps avoid the older cat health problems for the first few years. However, I vowed to be the best cat mom for Ava that I could be, and I looked into insurance for her. I did extensive research on this and ended up picking Healthy Paws for her. They had reasonable prices, great coverage, and awesome customer service. The first year or so went by and I did need to utilize her insurance once for a minor health issue, and I was very pleased with how smooth the entire claim and reimbursement process went. 

I should add now that I am both a veterinary technician and a third year veterinary student. I have access to far more services, people, and resources than most people being such an involved member of the veterinary community- and even I still desperately needed the help of pet insurance in the story I am about to share. 

A few weeks ago, my perfectly healthy, ONE year old cat very suddenly developed an extremely deep rectal fistula. No one can figure out how this happened, and it has mystified everyone who has seen her. It is basically a very deep draining tract into her body. A completely freak thing that is incredibly rare in cats. I brought her straight into work where the veterinarians at my practice then referred me to a speciality hospital in hopes that they would have more experience with this type of defect. Long story short, over the past 3 weeks, Ava has gone through 3 emergency visits, 2 hospitalizations, a CT scan, and an eventual 4 hour surgery. She continues to need extensive medical care over the next few months as she heals. And as a bonus to this all, she also was incidentally diagnosed with the start of feline asthma through this process, and will require a consult with an internist and life long treatment for that once we get her all healed up from this surgery. 

Even for someone with many connections within the veterinary community, this ordeal has been incredibly expensive. When Ava’s surgeon came in to go over my surgery estimate with me, he began by saying he had tried to come up with a plan that was as inexpensive as possible and only did the bare minimum necessities as he knew it would be very financially difficult for me as a student. The relief that I felt when I was able to tell the surgeon, no, I want the absolute best care for Ava, please do all that you recommend so that she has the best outcome possible is indescribable. Having Healthy Paws insurance allowed me to get, and continue to get, the best possible care for Ava without having to worry so much about the financial burden that goes along with it. 

Healthy Paws has been prompt and fair with reimbursing me for the many claims that I have needed to submit thus far through this whole process. They have personally checked in with me to see how Ava is feeling, and truly made me feel like they cared. 

I cannot strongly urge every pet owner out there to look into pet insurance for their pets, especially Healthy Paws. If it can happen to me with my one year old healthy cat and a member of the veterinary community, it can definitely happen to you too. Ava is my best friend and I cannot express how grateful I am to have her on the road to recovery with the help of Healthy Paws.",5,Healthy Paws helped me save my best friend,0,,2019-07-01T16:31:29.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=100

I can't say enough good things about Healthy Paws. We first signed up for it through an offer at the college where I work, and when I told people we had done so, I got a lot of comments about how we should just open a little savings account and put the amount we'd put toward the premium in there instead, leaving us with cash if Renard never needed it. 

Well, we don't have human kids; Renard is our baby and treated as such - and guess what? About four years after we rescued him, he developed very serious heart disease, and his twice-yearly cardiologist visits ALONE cost more than we put into the purchase of his policy... and that doesn't even begin to include the cost of a recent stay at an emergency hospital for his first episode of heart failure. After four days there, he's fully recovered - but with a $4200 bill attached, we would have had a real financial challenge if it weren't for Healthy Paws. Instead, I submitted the claim via the app (it took three minutes) and received a direct deposit less than a week later for about $3800. 

I was a believer before, just because it's important to me to be as prepared as possible to provide care to those I love, but now you can bet we will never go without Healthy Paws insurance for any of our pets.

After a lot of research, I decided to enroll Bear with Healthy Paws as their reputation was outstanding (at the time - on paper).  I remember thinking at the time that I’d likely rarely, if ever, have a reason to use the insurance, but I felt better being protected.  Boy, was I wrong.  Turns out, Bear likes to chew/destroy everything under the sun.  We had spent so much time/money puppy-proofing our home, and yet, he still found things to get into.  On two different occasions (in a two-month period of time), his bad habit had serious consequences and Bear required emergency veterinary care, an invasive abdominal surgery and several follow-up visits due to chronic intestinal inflammation.  While I was busy having Bear’s back and helping him to heal, Healthy Paws Pet Insurance had mine.  Their app makes submitting claims a breeze.  Their customer service is outstanding and available late into the evening for questions (and you always get a happy/helpful voice on the other end of the line – we all know how rare that is these days).  A rep from Healthy Paws even reached out to me the other day simply to find out how Bear was doing, and if we needed anything.  I was shocked – in the best possible way.

At just shy of the age of two, what we thought was an ACL/CCL tear was soon discovered to be severe hip dysplasia, in both hips, but needing just about immediate attention on the right hip. My almost two year old pup required a total hip replacement . Luckily enough, Healthy Paws covered hip dysplasia, and covered 80% of what would have been an almost $8,000 bill for me. They made it so beyond easy on my end. The made a pre-authorized same-day payment to my vet. My vet called and handled everything from there. They covered all additional related expenses. Again, little did anyone expect, but within 8 months of having a total hip replacement, my dog had popped his hip out, never gave any signs of pain, discomfort, until he couldn’t handle the pain anymore. Scar tissue formed a false hip socket, but eventually led to the feeling of bone-on-bone pain. Once again, my angels At Healthy Paws were there again! My dog required a hip-re-replacement and another costly surgery, and as previously done, they made a same-day payment for another $5,300 bill. I cannot express enough how thankful I am for them! My mind is always at ease knowing I don’t have to worry about my dog and medical treatment. They truly are angels. They make it so hassle free to submit a claim and they’re all extremely frienly and empathetic. Within a few days after returning home from both surgeries, Healthy Paws staff reached out to inquire about how my dog was doing. Anytime my pet comes up in conversation or I learn of someone who doesn’t have pet insurance yet or is planning on getting a dog, I ALWAYS brag about Healthy Paws and urge them to inquire!

I'm a pet parent to two awesome and quirky cats that our family adores and was heart broken when one of them came back with a diagnosis of mast cell cancer right before this last Christmas.  He was always so happy and healthy, and from what seemed like one week to the next, we were given the option of starting him on palliative care or going to a specialist to see if there was anything at all that could be done.  I wanted to give my kitty every chance to hold onto his life, so decided to take him to an oncologist and do whatever possible - whether it meant using up my savings or putting his care on a credit card.  Lots of specialist visits, major surgery, and ER stays later, my little cat is doing well beyond belief.  Even his oncologist is amazed!  The bills though, as can be imagined, have been off the charts.  I was with a different pet insurance company years ago before I found Healthy Paws and the reimbursement rate was pretty minimal, so it took me a while to even submit any claims this time around.  I have to say I was actually shocked in the best way at the service I received through Healthy Paws once push actually came to shove.  They initially needed my kitty's full medical records/history and reviewed that, but afterwards, all the claims I filed were taken care of immediately and the reimbursement level was incredible.  Submitting claims was also super easy through their app.  I was ready to use all my savings for my little kitty if that's what it took, but thanks to Healthy Paws, I didn't have to.  Service was transparent, extremely fair, and efficient - they even reached out to me to check in on my Thomas.  Before deciding what pet insurance company to go through, I did tons and tons of research.  I'd read good reviews about Healthy Paws, liked their customer service, and decided to take a chance.  I'm writing this review in the hopes of helping others out there going through the same process I went through, deciding to take a chance on a company, and not really knowing if they will come through when you may actually need for them to.

Now they sent me this on email:
""A pet....ON THE DATE OF ENROLLMENT must have undergone a COMPLETE clinical examination. ""   

If I can't provide this, ""any signs and symptoms noted (in claims submitted) would NOT be eligible for coverage."" because they will consider those as pre-existing condition.

Luckily, I can provide since the dog was an owner surrender.  and I know which vet they used.

58fbe2ca2ecbfc077c463d3f,False,False,"I have had my two pups for almost 9 years.  On January 1, 2014, one of my pups ruptured a disc in her back.  At that time, I did NOT have pet insurance.  After $7,000 in surgery/meds and 10 months of recovery...I decided maybe I should LOOK into pet insurance.  I did ALOT of research.  The one company that stood out was HEALTHY PAWS. I decided to get the coverage.  I selected the lowest deductible per month for each pup and selected the highest payout coverage for each.  I called my pups vet and the surgeon and asked them to email my pups records so I could send to Healthy Paws.  Once I received those files, I emailed them to Healthy Paws. 
It was VERY clear on what they cover.  NO PET INSURANCE will cover PRE-EXISTING conditions.  Makes purrfect sense to me.  Now some companies cover annual shots/exams/teeth cleaning/heartworm meds/etc.  HOWEVER those that do...have a CAP of what they will pay out.  Here is my opinion on PET INSURANCE.  If you are lucky enough to have a dog in your life.....one thing you should know.....SPAY/NEUTER/ANNUAL SHOTS/HEARTWORM...is all something that EVERY pet owner should do no matter what....it is part of being a responsible pet owner.  I knew when I rescued my pups...there is a cost to ensuring they are healthy and happy and loved.  BUT in the event something happens that is out of the normal range of taking care of your pet....snake bite, hurt paw/leg/back or any long term illness (paws crossed no one ever experiences this)...HEALTHY PAWS is INCREDIBLE.  So...after my dog hurt her back...I got coverage for both pups.  Oh doggie am I HAPPAWY I DID!  Since then, that same pup, had eye surgery (a big growth started growing in her eyelid), her right knee gave out...surgery for that....a year and a couple months later the left knee gave out..surgery for that.  So what did I pay for these 3 surgeries?  10% of the cost!!!  All meds that were prescribed after these surgeries were covered as well at 90%.  Oh..and the BEST thing is....if you download the app...you get home from vet....click on the APP...click on picture of PUP that you have....click on FILE a new claim...take a picture of the vet bill and hit submit.  Then a check magically appears in your mailbox!!!!  What if you don't know if something is covered?  Easy...either call them (they are SUPER friendly!!! OR just send it in via the APP.  If it is not covered they will deny it and provide the reason.   So...I did an analysis of what I have paid each month in premiums and  out of pocket with insurance AND compared it to what I would have paid had I not had insurance and premiums and just the knee surgeries alone made it worth it....if neither pup ever had anymore issues and if they live to 15...I am already ahead.  I HOPE neither of my pups NEVER meet their yearly deductibles ever again.....to me the peace of mind knowing Healthy Paws is there....with NO CAP on how much they will pay out....in the event there is something long term etc. is what makes them the BEST PET INSURANCE!!!  I will always have coverage on my pets and I know for a FACT......it will ALWAYS BE HEALTHY PAWS.  Not only did I give them 5 stars....but I would give them 4 paws up plus a wagging tail!!!!

We picked up Murphy New Years Day, 2012, and since then he has been away from us 2 days, and goes everywhere we do.
Shortly after we picked up Murphy we decided to enroll him in the Healthy Paws insurance program, never dreaming that it would be the wisest move too old people going into retirement could do.
About two years later , at the lake Murphy decided to leap off the bank and dive bomb the Ducks. He came out of the water, and you could tell from the look in his eyes something was wrong.
Turns out he had torn up his left rear knee and needed surgery. I called Healthy Paws, and they said he's covered, and you have a 10% deductible, let us know how it turns out.
\We had the surgery done, and the day after we brought him home, I submitted the claim to Healthy Paws on a Sat. afternoon. We received an e mail Mon stating you checks in the mail, and how is Murphy doing?
As a result of his injury Murphy has had to have regular ,water aquatic's, which Healthy Paws covers.
Two weeks ago I was operating the snow blower, and Murph was in the front yard. I glanced over to where he was on the trail we clear to the mail box, and he was sitting there with the look in his eyes, of Dad we have a problem.
I went over and he had either slipped, or fallen and history repeated itself, Murphy had damage to his right rear knee.
He had the surgery, a TPLO, and again Healthy Paws ,stood behind us, and is covering the expense.
The other thing that they understand is the relationship that their customers have with their pets, and it was surprising starting years ago that you would receive emails wondering how is Murphy doing?
I cannot say enough good things about Healthy Paws. I wish they were running the Health Care program for us old guys. My Buddy Murphy has better Health Care than we do Cheaper too.

In every case we have submitted there have never been any ""gotcha"" situations. They reimburse exactly as advertised.

58bb6e13ed30e30a74fc12af,False,False,"Hi Healthy Paws Team-

I wanted to take the time to share a personal story with you and why I believe strongly in pet insurance offered by Healthy Paws - not just any company - Healthy Paws.

After significant research, I decided to choose Healthy Paws to insure Wiggins, the puppy I found abandoned chained to a New York City park bench nearly 5 years ago. When I told family and friends about your service, some of them questioned the need, but I never waned: there is nothing I wouldn't do for him, and I give him the best of everything, from food, to healthcare, to overall love and affection.

Unfortunately, Wiggins suffered his first grand mal seizure last month - a terrifying experience to be sure. Knowing I had the best coverage and support of your team behind me meant the world to me as I visited the ER (after hours), followed up with my local vet, and even saw a specialist/neurologist! Everything was covered at 90% without question or claim payment delay. Sadly, Wiggins just had his second seizure two days ago and after a follow up visit to my vet, he is now taking Keppra 3x daily, a rather expensive and burdensome lifelong treatment. I am also able to take him in for an MRI to rule out any structural issues, to be certain of his idiopathic epilepsy diagnosis, and I know that Healthy Paws will be with me 100% of the way.

I want you to know how comforting this makes me feel. Having to bear the financial burden over the rest of his life would amplify the tremendous stress I - a single ""dad"" with a demanding job - now find myself under given Wiggins diagnosis. With Healthy Paws on my side, however, that burden is completely gone. Thank you!

You all should feel very proud to work for such an amazing organization as Healthy Paws. Each of you, no matter your job, touches lives like mine (and Wiggins) and I wanted to take a moment to recognize that.

Thank you.

It turned out to be osteosarcoma in her proximal humerus. She's a very athletic, out-going middle aged girl, it was very early in the disease process, so I opted for amputation and chemo.  Hospitalization for the amputation was supposed to be 3 days, turned out to be 5 days.  No complications, but dogs who have been using the amputated leg without a problem take longer to acclimate to having 3 legs, but the prognosis for them is better because the cancer is caught earlier.

I've had many dogs in my lifetime, but had never purchased pet insurance. I guess I always figured that the investment wouldn't ever really come back to me and that it might be a huge hassle needing to deal with claims, and the like. However, the last dog I had ended up costing me thousands after some unfortunate run-ins with wildlife, and his injuries continued to plague him (and us financially) until he passed several years and tens of thousands of dollars later. So, when we got our newest addition, we knew that we wanted to try out an insurance program.
Of course, within the first year, she has had a terribly split toenail that needed immediate medical attention as well as a large mass that needed to be removed from her back leg, requiring surgery. Normally, this would have caused some serious emotional and financial stress. But, I am thrilled to share that Healthy Paws made the claim and reimbursement so incredibly easy that I could focus all of my energy on my sweet puppy. I literally just snapped a photo of the vet bill, sent it to the company through their app on my phone, and was quickly approved and sent a check. My experience in both instances (i.e., split toenail and surgery), were handled in such an easy, streamlined and efficient manner that I will be a lifetime customer of this company and sing their praises wherever possible. Oh! And they emailed me after the claim cleared just to see how my dog was recovering!!! It's like they actually care!

In fact, pet owners and companies conducting reviews of all healthy insurance agencies recommended HP without reservation and it was almost always the #1 rated and recommended company.  What I also found pretty incredible, was the easy to use mobile app that allows me to manage my dogs' policies, submit and track claims on my phone (by taking a picture), and the quick turn around (claims are reviewed within a few days of submission and checks are received within a week of the claim filing).

We had recently purchased Healthy Paws insurance from a recommendation and took our kitten in to the vet during the Healthy Paws 15 day grace period because she had an eye infection. Silly us for trying to take care of our cat.

After the grace period had passed, our kitten began to show very worrying symptoms unrelated to her eye. Over the course of the next few days, we took her back to the vet, and then escalated to emergency hospitals, etc. But FIP is incurable, and we were unfortunately not able to save her. After many tears, we started filing claims with Healthy Paws. Despite the pain of losing the kitten, my wife and I were glad that we had recently bought insurance.

But it turned out that didn't matter. Even though the vet had not initially linked the eye infection to FIP, Healthy Paws decided that it was evidence of a pre-existing condition and denied every single one of our claims related to our kitten's illness and death. They said they were very sympathetic to our loss, but still denied the claims.

No doubt Healthy Paws will respond to this review with all kinds of excuses. But the fact is that as responsible pet-parents we took our kitten to the vet for a minor eye infection during the Healthy Paws grace period and Healthy Paws decided that was enough to deny all claims. We would have been in a much better situation if we were irresponsible and just let our kitten suffer the eye infection until the grace period was over. Then Healthy Paws couldn't have claims a pre-existing condition.

I do my best to keep them safe but my dogs are professional trouble-finders and we've made more than a few trips to the emergency vet through the years.  So far I've spent more on the insurance than I have received back on claims but this isn't about breaking even.  It's about insurance for those scary things that happen while the last thing you want to be thinking about is how you'll pay for it all.  

I've submitted some small online claims to Healthy Paws in the past year.  I was very impressed by how quickly and how accurately they were processed/reimbursed.  Healthy Paws does not reimburse for some things like vaccinations, preventive meds, or vet exam fees.    They offer different levels of deductibles/reimbursement rates, which makes it easy to compare prices and select a plan.  I also got a bit of a discount on the rates when I adopted a second dog and added her to the policy.  Monthly premiums are automatically billed to my credit card, making the whole thing seamless and easy.  And yes, the premiums do increase by a small amount every year.  When I compared different pet insurance plans, this Healthy Paws seemed to cover more major treatment expenses than the rest, which is why I ultimately chose them.  All in all I'm really happy with this company and I truly appreciate knowing we'll be in great hands (or paws) when we need it the most.",5,"Fast & Easy Claims, Peace of Mind",0,,2016-05-01T20:52:27.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=107

They lead their company with service excellence and when you become part of the Healthy Paws family, you join (and stay!) because of the level of service.

The claims are reviewed soon after you submit it and the check is in your hands within a week. 

Beyond the basic premise of doing and providing what you pay Healthy Paws for, they actually care about you and your pet.  For example, my baby Luna (a 3 year old pit mix pup), recently tore her ACL and after submitting the claim for her surgery, Tim from their amazing client services department reached out to check in on how her recovery was going.  He didn't have to do this, but he went just one simple step above and beyond what I expected and really personalized our experience with HealthyPaws. 

I rave about Healthy Paws to anybody that will listen!  Their service is second to none and we are so lucky to have them as our insurance provider.

What I really liked was that Ryan actually tried to sell me a less expensive policy! What a shock that was! I was also impressed by the fact that there is no maximum to coverage do to an accident.

I made sure that I had a full comprehensive physical exam (bloodworm etc) done early on to show that my dog was healthy.  I felt that this would help with any future claims I may have to make. 
Long story short - a few months after getting insurance for my pup, she became devastatingly ill.  Despite being on a topical flea/tick preventative, she contracted ehrlichia (like Lyme Disease).  The symptoms were dramatic - extreme lethargy, limping, swollen joints, weight loss - It took lots of tests and even a joint tap to see that she indeed had the infection.  Over $1000 later and she was feeling much better! Healthy paws paid out 90% on every claim I made!
Then, my vet notices that the limping was not just due to the ehrlichia, my dog had a recent partially torn cruciate ligament - perhaps due to weakness/muscle wasting from the ehrlichia.  Over $4000 later for surgery and she's got full range of motion and is happily walking and running with ease (although we don't play ball any more after finding out how hard it is on their joints/ligaments). 
Well, I wish I could say that was the last of it, but there have been two trips to the emergency vet - once for a relapse of the ehrlichia and another time after my dog started vomiting during a camping trip.  Thank god she ended up being fine, but dogs can scare the heck out of you and it is such a relief to know that if something major comes up you won't have to sell your house to pay the vet bills.
My dog goes everywhere with me and I watch her like a hawk.  She's extremely well trained and is even my ""demo dog"" for training consultations (I'm a dog trainer).  No matter how much you train and care for your dog, if you take them out into the world, you never know what can happen.  Also, Healthy Paws covers congenital illness, so even if you're dog/cat lives in a bubble, they are still covered if genetic illness or cancer strikes.

I was not looking forward to having yet another monthly bill, but I thought it was a good idea to have insurance if any of my family's beloved pets became ill or had a sudden accident.  I did plenty of research before deciding on Healthy Paws, and I located and carefully read all the 'fine print"" on theirs and other insurance carriers' contracts.   Healthy Paws was straight forward and not too expensive, and I also noticed in my research what appeared to be many real and satisfied customers.  My older pet understandably required a higher deductible, and as with almost all pet insurance carriers, pre-existing conditions were not covered.  However, the deductible was not too high and was payable every year, NOT every incident like other insurance carriers.  
About 8-months after signing up for Healthy Paws, my 11 year old male cat had a urinary blockage, that led to a bladder rupture, that quickly spiraled beyond the expertise of my vet and required a specialist and also emergency care/hospitalization.  The bills quickly piled on to amounts that weakened my knees, but luckily, I had savings, and I wasn't sure if Healthy Paws would hold up its end of the bargain once I submitted my pets' history and invoices.  Surprisingly, there was about a one-week turn around for each claim (shorter amount of time than they indicated), and I was reimbursed as promised with no complications.  
Through a tough battle, my cat was saved, and is currently in recovery, and I was able to focus on getting him better with the comfort of knowing that I had an honest and ethical insurance company to cover the majority of the bills as they promised they would.  
Being ethical and an insurance company are two things that are usually not expected to go hand-in-hand, but my emergency experience with Healthy Paws has restored my faith that there are actually companies still out there trying to do right by their customer.  Our family has their best friend back, and our cat was able to get the best treatment possible.  When considering pet insurance, read the fine print before signing up, and keep in mind my experience, because if there's the slightest chance your pet can survive an emergency situation, Healthy Paws will afford you peace of mind so that you can focus on finding that chance and possibly enjoy many more years with your pet/companion/best-friend.",5,"Ethical, Honest, was really there when we needed them",0,,2016-02-14T01:38:49.491Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=108

After my last Jack Russell died and I had incurred over $20,000 in bills, I changed my mind.  After doing careful research, I secured Healthy Paws 90% plan.  The price was very reasonable, they did not cancel you for chronic diseases and they didn't raise your premium after you had incurred costly claims.  I cost them nothing for one year.  However, the last three years, having a fairly ""healthy"" Jack Russell, Annie still experienced a lot of very expensive conditions to pay for - over $10,000.  Allergic conditions requiring the only dog allergist in Northern Virginia and cutting edge treatments.  A benign tumor that cost $3,000 to diagnose at a dog cancer center and $2,500 to excise and other assorted and miscellaneous conditions.  Healthy Paws certainly lost money on us. Nevertheless, they always paid our claims within 4 days, sent us condolence notes in email, when Annie was going through a particularly difficult illness and never failed to send her birthday and holiday cards. They also give a portion of her monthly insurance fee to dog charities.

Now, 6 years later, it is literally one of the best decisions I've ever made. My puppy (who will always be a puppy even when she's 6 years old) has managed to...

*  Eat chocolate bars 3 times   (Three ER Visits)
*  Eaten something else that made her horribly sick   (1 ER Visit)

*  Had 2 teeth removed because they broke 
*  Had multiple stool sample tests for giardia & other digestive issues
*  Had blood tests prior to both oral surgeries

""Oh, she cracked a tooth...let's take it out before it gets abscessed.""  There's simply no question.  Without Healthy Paws, that one tooth would have cost me over $1000.  Also, the reality is that I would go into serious debt to make sure my dog was healthy.  I’d do almost anything in the world for her, even if it meant I would be put into a challenging financial position.  Thankfully, that’s not an issue.  Thankfully, I got healthy paws!

John and I talked about pet insurance a few times last year, but didn't know anyone else who had it so we weren't sure if it was worth it or not. Fast forward to June, when the universe brought me a horrific story about a friend's experience with dog sitting and the Pet ER that totally rocked my world. I signed the dogs up immediately with Healthy Paws, the insurance we had been considering, and that was that.

Just after Labor Day Appa was playing ball with some friends - trying to be the best, as he does - and he started limping. The limp got worse, so we called our Vet and had it checked out. Keeping fingers crossed that it was just a soft tissue injury, we waited a few more days and it got worse. Back to the Vet.

This week he had surgery to repair his torn cruciate ligament, and we are embarking on a two month recovery followed by two months of rehab. With a 50% chance he'll damage his other leg at some point, our insurance covered $3,400 of a $4,400 hospital bill. On top of that, since this wasn't a pre-existing condition his other legs are covered (heaven forbid) he should tear another.

No one ever plans for a pet emergency, but in this instance having the insurance and knowing we could afford to pursue the best course of treatment available for our Appa made this whole situation just the teensiest bit less stressful.

561aae340000ff0009100d93,False,False,"Going in,  you know that ownership of a French bulldog will eventually result in some kind of health issue and it will be an expensive health issue.  Sad but true, and you hope it is many years down the line.  Unfortunately, it happened early on in my case.  I got my Frenchie when he was four months old and started researching pet health companies right away, assuming I could wait awhile to enroll him somewhere. 

I found all kinds of information and ratings online and began obtaining quotes.  HealthyPaws premiums were in line with all of the others I looked at, but they covered hereditary conditions.  Some of the other companies did not but still cost the same.  Even better, with HealthyPaws, you can choose your annual deductible and level of coinsurance.  Knowing that Frenchies are subject to those types of conditions, I enrolled him when he was six months old. The enrollment process was quick and easy and I have access to the website 24/7.  

He was deemed healthy at his first vet visit other than giardia and coccidiosis which are common in kennels and passed onto the puppies.  We got him squared away with some meds and puppy hygiene and all was well.  The vet sent his records to HealthyPaws ensuring that he was now healthy.

Over the summer, I took him in for his visit to get set up with flea meds and arrange for his neuter (not covered under HealthyPaws), and my vet said that his nostrils had closed up (they were wide open at his initial visit) and he had developed cherry eye; she recommended that he receive corrective surgery for both these conditions; she also said that with the nares surgery, there was a good chance his soft palate would have to be corrected as well.  I was devastated; here was an 11-month old sweet puppy going in for a quick neutering procedure and coming out with major surgery ahead of him.

He had his corrective surgery done which cost $3,000+ and was successful. During the procedure, he had a lump develop on his muzzle which the surgeons treated as an allergic reaction but which continued to grow over the next week.  Back to our regular vet for another visit and a biopsy (two surgeries in two weeks on a Frenchie are risky due to their breathing issues) to find that the muzzle issue was a papilloma virus (warts!) which he could have picked up anywhere.  More antibiotics and he is well again.

The second surgery was $500+. Both claims were submitted and adjudicated within 10 days. Given the annual deductible, the neutering, and coinsurance, my cost for everything was less than $900! I know, that still is a lot of money, but had he not had HealthyPaws, he would not have been able to be treated and would have to live a possibly shorter life with compromised health.  His quality of life is now excellent and his energy level has skyrocketed.  

One of my co-workers just got a Boston terrier puppy, and in discussing our new family members, I learned he had chosen HealthyPaws as well after doing his own research.  I told him that he was in good hands and that he will be very happy with them should he ever need them.  

I would recommend anyone to choose HealthyPaws when looking for insurance for their pets.",5,HealthyPaws could not be any better!,0,,2015-10-11T18:45:08.163Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.healthypawspetinsurance.com?page=110

The bill was approximately $18k. Within hours of his discharge from the first hospital I had an email from Healthy Paws closing out the claim and confirming that a check for 90% - our deductible was on the way. Throughout this process, HP has checked in on Chompx, and shown genuine concern for our little man.  When we were first told he was to be hospitalized, HP offered support and told us just to focus on Chompx. That was such a relief. I expected there would be issues with reimbursement, that seems to be the issue with all insurance companies.. there was no issue, no fuss, no drama.  I had the reimbursement check within days!  Afterwards, they emailed to check on Chompx as well. Throughout this nightmare, they have shown genuine concern for Chompx and they have taken the biggest burden off our minds as we focus on Chompx's recovery. Simple, flawless, expedited reimbursement for your pet's medical needs. Finally a pet insurance that actually does what it says. I've never had a dog with any serious medical issue such as this, I never thought I'd need this, but I am so glad we had it. I will never risk being without Healthy Paws pet insurance again, because no matter how careful you are, anything can happen. Throughout our crisis with Chompx (over 5 weeks in ICU) we've seen countless owners forced to make the ultimate sacrifice with their beloved pets simply because of finances.  It's been heartbreaking to see this happen over and over again.  Whatever the end result is with Chompx (still ongoing) we know that because of Healthy Paws, we have been able to provide the very best possible outcome for him and that every measure has been taken to give him a chance for a full recovery.

He was born with luxating patella stage 3 in both back legs, and had to have surgery only a couple months after I brought him home. Then when he was about 1 the vet thought it was a bowel obstruction and he had another surgery, but it turned out he did not have an obstruction but rather his intestines had swollen almost shut from food allergies. About a month ago (he’s not even 2 yet) he started limping again, had x-rays and turned out he had torn all the ligaments in his knee and had to have yet another surgery on his leg. Healthy Paws has been there for us through every single obstacle.

56018ad70000ff00090a9431,False,False,"I just want to say a big THANK YOU for Healthy Paws.  I am so thankful to have Healthy Paws Pet Insurance which gives me the financial peace of mind to cover my best buddy, Button when he has emergency issues.

Button was an owner-surrendered Yorkshire Terrier to a Manhattan, NYC kill shelter in 2012.  He was saved from death by Anarchy Rescue, and then sent to Yorkie 911 Rescue for further rehabilitation.  I counted that I am his 5th home!  We fell in love with him at a dog adoption day, and never looked back.  The term ""who rescued who"" is so appropriate in our home; since I do not have any children (just plenty of nieces and nephews!!!).  With a rescue, you have a health unknown, and thankfully he had no pre-existing conditions which might exclude him from some coverage.

The decision to have pet insurance was to insure me that this little dog's life would never have a price tag on him again; nor will I every throw him away as many dog owners do when financial issues of pet care could cause a burden.  I read about Healthy Paws through an AAA recommendation, and the company has not let me down.  I can handle the day-to-day, well-doggie costs with the vet; but, my dog has had a few emergencies due to his getting into trouble or from an unexpected illness, and those vet bills were scary.  The insurance has provided me with such peace of mind, knowing that my dog gets great care, when I hand over the credit card.

Button's recent ear canal surgery was health threatening, (sad and scary for the pet parents, we were fearful that we might loose him), and the associated vet bill was even scarier.  I actually called Healthy Paws before the surgery just like I do for my own insurance ""just in-case"".  Customer support gave me peace of mind to move forward. After the surgery, the reimbursement was at 90% - paid very, very promptly!

Button almost died during the surgery.  He had a TECA (total ear canal ablation), and is now hearing in only one good ear--now a special needs dog (but he has adjusted  to his lost hearing).  He endured two weeks recovering with the ""cone of shame"", eye drops, while we tried to keep him calm and confined.  After the two weeks, the vet surgeon gave Button a ""thumbs up""!  Button is a happy, healthy dog--back to his old self.  Without the expert care of two vets, my Button Buddy would have died.  I am hoping that now he has a lot of dog treats, belly rubs,and life left in him for a few more years.  With your insurance, he will definitely have that emergency care as he ages with the amazing coverage that you provide.  I have been recommending Healthy Paws to many of my dog owners friends for their consideration

We hoped we would never have to use it, but in the almost 5 months Dixie has been home with us, we have had to use it multiple times.
