Check ups were not covered in my policy at that time. The doctor noted that my cat was constipated, and recommended a science diet recipe.  

Two weeks ago I had to take my cat to  emergency care because he had not eaten, urinated or had a bowel movement in 24 hours.  I did not treat my cat at emergency care, he was given subcutaneous fluids; and since he was not in crisis, he was released without a diagnosis or prescription.

The next morning I took my cat to our current vet.  He was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection for which he was given antibiotics.

…. BUT because my previous vet in 2019 gave my cat a laxative, my claims were denied.  The constipation was one of the symptoms for his most recent treatment NOT the condition, but even so my claims were denied.

I have filed two claims (most recent emergency care and follow up)  in the last five years, only to be denied because my cat had been constipated five years ago.

This is an egregious breech of contract.  The pact is that I  pay my insurance premium every month, so should my cat become ill, I can provide my four-legged family member the medical care he requires, even if it’s thousands of dollars.

65d61e13658b199d1a9dd192,False,False,"Figo, the king of insurance Gaslighting. 

They first tire you out by making you jump through hoops, then make you happy, then not pay, then ghost you, then more hoops, then deny your claim on any technicality they can find. Then deny your appeal because you had a legitimate claim. Because they know that you won’t sue them. Psychopaths.

 Despite my initial enthusiasm and hope, they have proven to be unreliable and untrustworthy as an insurance provider. Here’s a rundown of the issues I’ve encountered:

	1.	After filing a claim, it was closed without explanation, leaving me waiting for payment for 14 days.
	2.	Upon contacting them, I was kept on hold for 27 minutes only to be told they needed more information, which they allegedly already communicated to my vet. However, my vet confirmed they received no such notification.
	3.	When I followed up with Figo, I was informed their app was down and that they would now process the claim.
	4.	Despite their assurances, I was then bombarded with paperwork and additional tasks for my vet.
	5.	After more back-and-forth, I received a claim closed email with a broken link and no information in the Figo app.
	6.	Upon calling again, I was told my plan didn’t cover the incident because it fell outside a 14-day grace period for illnesses, being day 13, and that the day I signed up was not the day they started my plan. Even though it was an injury, not an illness. They then cited a bizarre 6-month grace period for skeletal injuries, leaving me baffled and frustrated.

I had signed up for their highest-tiered plan at $57 a month for my recently rescued Chihuahua, only to be met with disappointment and a sense of being scammed. This experience has left me questioning the legitimacy of their services and I am requesting, at the very least, a refund of my initial premium payment.",1,Figo,1,2024-02-20T00:00:00.000Z,2024-02-21T18:00:20.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/figopetinsurance.com?page=5

While their marketing and support teams shine with a solid 5-star rating, the experience with the claim department tells a different tale. In an unregulated realm of insurance, Figo seems to exploit the lack of oversight by crafting policies with vague language. The claim department operates on a subjective basis, free to approve or deny based on unclear criteria.
For instance, the policy vaguely excludes ""pre-existing conditions"" without offering a proper definition. Most would assume ""pre-existing"" refers to ongoing issues or those present at policy inception, not something your pet was cured of in the past. Figo's agents appear more focused on delving into your pet's medical history, searching for any past ailment that could be loosely connected to the current issue, even if they're unrelated.

I feel that Figo does not care about the satisfaction of its customers or the health of their pets. I have cancelled auto-renewal of my policy, and have told other people to stay away from Figo.

the final reveal that I have been scammed is that they declined over $1k in dental surgery costs my pet required for tooth extractions by referencing their policy that any sort of prior dental issue makes them not liable to pay for dental issues.  Even if the event needing coverage is unrelated to the condition that was present during the waiting period. Meaning, because my pet had evidence of the grade 1 tarter (the lowest besides 0) during the waiting period they denied payment for her tooth extractions caused by periodontal disease.  The vet even wrote a letter stating this disease was not present prior to her needing the extractions. My pet had regular and repeated exams that never revealed any issues or treatment plans for her teeth.  Their fine print allows them to deny coverage because she had this minor issue and unrelated issue.  What's the point of having insurance when you can find a way to weasel out of paying every claim?

Another way of legally scammed people what's the point of paying for insurance if you have to pay first and then submit the bill to them to get reimbursed that's if your vet even does anything at all which in my case they have not done anything at all figo said they email them three times. I call them one time the office manager and she said she will submit the information back to figo which obviously it has not been done.
With kaiser insurance e health plan for people you are paying just as you are paying for this dog insurance buy the difference is you don't have to pay anything to get the help you need and then get reimbursed this scenario will only happen if you are out of the contry. 
I thought figo was a good insurance company 🤔 because of costco recommended but it turns out is just another scammed.
As soon is am back in the states and finish this none sense I will cancel and maybe look for another company or just pay out of pocket since is what I had to do in the first place and the purpose of having insurance is just a joke.

6463e282a688b0ec43afc42a,False,False,"I experienced the same frustrations and failures of service that many, many, many other customers have experienced with Figo Pet Insurance. It is amazing to me that, having had so many complaints about the same issues, over and over again, Figo continues to act in a purposefully misleading manner and continues to fail in providing customer service.

First, “pre-existing condition” seems to mean “your pet was alive when you got this insurance” and they simply flat out refuse to cover any medical issues at all. I have attempted to make 3 completely justified claims, all clearly allowed by my policy, and Figo has given the same reason for denying my claim all three times: not allowed due to a “pre-existing condition.”

The key example is that my dog had to have two teeth removed, $1,300 for each tooth, for a total of $2,600 in fees. My insurance has a $1,000 deductible, so I was assuming I would get $1,600 back. I submitted my claim and, within a few hours, received my rejection due to “pre-existing condition.” 

Figo indicated that a vet examination (WHILE my dog was covered by insurance) identified a fracture on ONE of the teeth, but not the other. IF I am willing to accept that this one tooth wasn’t covered (due to the vet identifying a “likely carnassial fracture,” even though my dog was still covered by insurance), then the other cracked tooth SHOULD be covered since it was NOT identified by the vet during the previous exam. 


Yep, you guessed it, Figo rejected my claim for BOTH teeth, citing the vet report. Basically, my dog was not covered for ANY dental emergency of any kind because he had ONE problem with ONE tooth previously. An absolute joke, and a clear case of fraud. 

After multiple attempts at communication with Figo customer service, they essentially just copied and pasted the same response back to me…ie… “pre-existing condition, pre-existing condition.” 

FIGO insurance will make every attempt to refuse a payout if they can and will use “pre-existing condition” as the excuse. 

This insurance is a complete waste of money; not only am I out the money for my pet’s treatment, I am also out the premiums for this 100% useless pet insurance. 

Read the reviews online carefully and you will see the complaint over and over again.

In reality, it's extremely difficult to get anything to apply to your coverage.  I am a benefits specialist, and very familiar with reading benefit plan documents and interpreting coverage.  There has been many instances where my pet's condition/injury/illness may have been covered but were denied.  After going through the claims dispute process, I still wasn't satisfied with FIGO's rejection.  I renewed coverage for a second year out of convenience.

63fe42159b64b1bdaf6538a3,False,False,"This reimbursement plan has been absolutley stellar the first year of coverage. It's a necessity these days as veterinary services have increased 3fold the last few years. If you're uninsured and complaining about vet bills, you're doing it wrong.

I see most of the negative reviews are mostly lack of knowledge of how the plan works. First off, it's a ""reimbursement plan"" meaning; you pay for services and upload receipts, if they meet the plans criteria, a percentage is reimbursed. You also don't need to stay ""in network"" but you also have to meet your deductible before the reimbursement payments start. You also have to READ your policy before signing off, because that's half the battle. I inadvertently didn't include wellness my first years policy, and questioned why a certain bill was denied and they just explained wellness wasn't selected and to make sure to select when renewing. Calling/texting them directly is the best way to communicate and they strive for doing just that, clear explanations.

If it's seen as ""pre-existing"", no, they won't cover so it's usually the veterinarian that determined that to be the case, as they will sometimes contact the vet directly when there are questions or treatment notes are needed. It's the best we've had, and they continue to be now for over a year. READ the plans people, before purchasing. The uploads can be filed within the Pet Cloud app VERY easily, and I just snap a pic/scan on phone, open app, and submit. There is nothing easier. If you don't use smart phone, you'll need to scan and upload the bills via computer.

Make sure you know what your deductible is as well. You have so many plans to choose from and add-ons to protect your expenses.

631240907f7a8621ee50eacd,False,False,"Great marketing gets you in the door.  But dealing with claims people feels like insurance.  

Sample FIGO communication regarding our dog's ortho waiver: ""Thank you for providing this information. We have received [your dog's] completed orthopedic waiver form with the exam performed on 08/20/2021. This has been reviewed and applied to his policy. The 6-month waiting period has now been waived for the orthopedic conditions that were assessed during the 08/20/2021 exam and do not show any clinical signs or symptoms. The left front limb is excluded based on the waiver and medical records received from [your dog's] veterinarian. The waiver and medical records show outside palpation and a recommendation for radiographs. Until a further orthopedic exam and diagnostics can be run, these conditions may not be eligible for coverage as they were noted to be abnormal on the waiver and medical records. To clarify, the orthopedic waiver is not a guarantee of coverage.""

All that because our vet's exam notes indicated: ""Outside palpation - looks OK.  If further test needed recommend x-ray.""  The waiver form doesn't require an x-ray.  And the vet's note just indicated the limits of his exam (palpation).  Seems clear to me.  But it wasn't to the FIGO ""claims support team.""    

So, after incurring the expense of a vet exam to get FIGO's ortho waiver form signed, we decided to just wait out the 6 month ortho exclusion period rather than jump through more hoops (and incur more expense) for the FIGO claims support team.  

We haven't made any claims under our policy (which we have renewed for a second year), and hopefully, we won't need to.  But, based on the ortho waiver experience, I wouldn't be surprised if there are more hoops to jump through.

Just prior to that puppies 1 year birthday, he came down with horrible diarrhea, lethargy and wouldn't eat.  I took him to the vet who diagnosed him accordingly (nothing too serious), and provided appropriate prescriptions.  I then submitted the claim to Figo.  To my shock, Figo immediately rejected my claim, on the basis that the diarrhea was a ""pre-existing condition.""  Huh?? First, how is diarrhea a ""pre-existing"" condition? Second, even if it was the symptom of some ""pre existing"" condition, what possible ""pre-existing"" condition could a full-bred Golden-Retriever puppy have that would cause diarrhea?  I had provided all of our puppies documents, vaccine records, and medical clearances when I submitted the claim.  On top of that, I provided the name and phone number of the breeder in case they had any questions.  Furious with this decision, I appealed the decision.  Figo responded that because I had not provided medical documents with SOAP notes,  any condition my dog had within the first 12 months of the policy was considered ""pre existing.""  I then resubmitted all of my dog's paperwork.  Suddenly, it was sufficient; they reversed their appeal and applied costs to my deductible. ""Ok,"" you say, ""you got what you were entitled to.""  Well, the story isn't over.  When I looked at the EOB to review what had been applied, it was pennies on the dollar.

She is going on 4 years old. Some years I never met the deductible and thought what a waste, do I really need insurance? Which was good, that meant she was healthy. Other years I was very glad I had it paid in full. She had two emergency health issues, one life or death. I was comfortable knowing that a $ was not the deciding factor if she would come home or not. When I was in the waiting room wondering if she would make it, I would have given the world to have her back in my arms. So if I have to scrimp and save, brown bag it, and work overtime to keep her healthy and insured, I am willing to pay the price. Sacrifices have to be made for those you love. 

There are so many different options available, everyone should be able to find a plan they can afford. Customer service is always willing to crunch numbers and run different scenarios with you to find a plan with our budget.

I have never had a claim denied, just put on ""hold"" waiting for clarification notes from the vet. Customer service has always replied within 24 hours and claims are paid quickly. I have found FIGO support to be helpful, compassionate, and professional both on the phone and through emails.

61635690b873f1f75f5c2b3d,False,False,"Do not buy FIGO pet insurance. There are many other options available. I chose FIGO because Costco added them as a preferred outside vendor.  I thought I could trust Costco to filter out the bad companies. Wrong.

Let me start by saying that the FIGO website and app are very easy to use. This is the only good thing about FIGO.

During the 14 day waiting period, unfortunately,  my puppy began a  prolonged period of diarrhea, coughing, lethargy, no food or liquid intake. I decided to have the vet check him. I could not point to a root cause and did not want to spend hundreds of dollars on diagnostics. The vet treated the symptoms with an injection of fluid and anti-vomiting meds. All of this I knew wouldn't be covered by insurance because there was a $250 deductible. It didn't matter to me that this was during the waiting period. My puppy was very sick.

Fast forward 6 weeks, my now 11 month old pup is exposed to canine influenza at daycare. Daycare sent a notice to all it's clients that they are waiting for the results, but they suspect a coughing dog was infected with canine influenza during the time my pup was boarded. A few days later, my dog began uncontrollable coughing, spitting up, loss of appetite, and lethargy. When I took him for a vet exam, we talked about his likely exposure to canine influenza. Thus, I waived the expensive tests and agreed to treat the symptoms. Four days later, his symptoms continued as his health declined even further. I had to pick him up to move him from room to room.  I went to the vet again for a recheck. My pup received fluids again and also an appetite stimulant. The vet concurred that my pup was highly likely infected with canine influenza since there had been other dogs presenting the same symptoms. Los Angeles County health confirmed this outbreak.  

(As a side bar, I used the  ""chat with a live vet"" feature on FIGO. Useless. The vet offered nothing of substance. In fact, based on the symptoms, the vet said I should take my pup to see a vet.)

FIGO denied these claims. FIGO said these episodes were a continuation of pre-existing conditions. While it is true that coughing and loss of appetite were common symptoms the first and second times,  the CAUSE of each illness was unrelated.  When does a perfectly healthy pup who was cleared by the vet as being so a few months earlier during his wellness exam, now become classified chronically ill?

I discussed this with a customer service rep twice. I mentioned that daycare issued a notice to all it's clients about the suspected canine influenza outbreak. She said she would forward this notice to the adjuster for reconsideration.

If I have to go to this length to prove my pup was sick and needed care, then what exactly does FIGO cover?  Based on my experience, FIGO won't ever cover an illness with noted cough, loss of appetite, lethargy, and diarrhea symptoms.

Folks, don't waste your money. There are other well-established insurers who provide better insurance coverage.",1,Do not buy FIGO pet insurance,1,,2021-10-10T21:09:36.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/figopetinsurance.com?page=59

The day I brought her home, I got pet insurance for her through Figo. I knew I was going to go with Figo because I did much research and found they had the best reviews/reports through CR and the BBB and at a very reasonable monthly cost. (I chose the $10,000 yearly coverage with 90% reimbursement.) Fast forward to 3 1/2 years later. She started having mid-back to hind feet spasms regularly. She wouldn’t/couldn’t walk and was attacking her back paws as if they didn’t belong to her. If I tried to touch them, she would attack my hands. This is very unlike her, as she’s not a biter. Off to the vet for X-rays, but nothing was found. They suspected nerve issues. After 2 months of weekly acupuncture, canine massage, PEMF treatments, and 4 different meds 2x/day, she wasn’t really getting better. So off we went to the neurologist for an MRI. Turns out Bug has a congenital condition that affects her spinal cord from the thoracic area on down. She’s holding her own now on all the correct medications and an at-home exercise program. Figo has lived up to their reputation and exceeded it, in my opinion! I could never have afforded all of her treatments without them. Plus it’s so easy! I use the app to file her claims for her vet fees, medications, etc. Within 3-5 business days, 90% of what I paid out is directly deposited back into my bank account. My baby, Bug, means the world to me, and without Figo I would never have been able to afford her medical care. I’m so happy I made the choice to go with Figo Pet Insurance 4 years ago.

600914c8755dc109e8e0c58d,False,False,"We initially loved Figo, especially because we insured our cat later in life, and not a lot of pet insurance companies offer decent pet insurance when the pets are older. Figo (or at least our policy) was originally underwritten by Markel. When they were bought out by Independence America (last year or two), they literally tripled our premium at the renewal date, and substantially reduced the benefits and also created a huge spike in our deductible. Plus, the customer service during that transition was very uneducated and not very helpful. That alone was very disappointing. 

But then, they became incredibly focused on scrutinizing each claim to find a reason to not pay it. Any loophole they can find, they leverage it. I have had to appeal two separate claims and even with letters from the vet, indicating why the treatment fell under my policy’s terms, they don’t budge - or budge very minutely, but not enough to really make a difference. 

Also, some of the terms make no sense. For example, they don’t cover oral surgery, at all - even if it’s due to an illness or disease. Our cat has an oral mass that needed to be removed and in order to remove the mass, they had to remove the tooth. Figo decided not to cover the entire surgery because they claim that it was oral surgery to do a tooth extraction. They said they would only cover it, if it was an accident/injury - not an illness. But the main reason that we get pet insurance is to cover illness, diseases, etc. This simply doesn’t make sense to me. 

And now, they are not paying things that they had paid a few months ago (still same policy year). It’s super sad and discouraging to pour so much into premiums and deductibles, only to find them constantly finding loopholes to not pay the claims. 

We have Healthy Paws for our other 3 creatures - literally Thank God.

5fce8456755dc1076896d5d3,False,False,"Firstly, I want to say that I wish I had researched any bad reviews years ago before I ever signed up with FIGO. It seems that others are in the same boat as I am! I have been a loyal customer of FIGO for approximately 4-5 years now. I have NEVER needed to use the insurance however, I continually paid my monthly premium on auto-pay (by now, thousands of dollars total). I initially went with them because one always worries about getting coverage for pre-existing conditions whether it be minor or major and they seem to have stated they had a good policy with regards to considering a pre-existing condition something that has happened within the last 18 months. Well, for the first time in a while, I had to bring my cat to the vet as he had a small lump on his jawline... I wound up spending a little over $400 however, I was glad to know in the back of my mind that I had EXPENSIVE coverage for Koby's medical needs. Guess what? They only paid my visit fee and denied everything else(did not pay it really, it went toward my exorbitant yearly deductible)!!!! First of all, it even states on the explanation of benefits that, ""Any illness or other condition that first occurred or displayed any signs and/or symptoms consistent with the stated illness or condition within 18 months prior to the pet policy effective date or prior to the expiration of any applicable waiting period""... Ok, I called customer service, maybe this was a mistake. I asked for an explanation and the rep confirmed that Koby had a lump on his lip back in 2013 so it is considered pre-existing.. wait a minute, what is the whole thing about the 18 months prior to starting an insurance policy with them? (2013 was over 2-3 years before I ever signed up with FIGO!).. I was told basically, read the fine print in our policy.. Ok, not only this but in 2013 he was brought to the vet for a swollen ball on the tip of his lip (allergic reaction to his food bowl - plastic).. as soon as we changed his bowl to metal, it went away and never came back. Now in 2020, he had a lump on the side of his jawbone and it will not be covered. This just sounds too funny to me. Every year, your premium goes up and goes up quite a bit at that. Like I said, I have paid A LOT in the past few years each month to ensure I have coverage for my cat. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!! I could have literally put that money away each month as if I were contributing to an emergency vet fund for any vet bills I would need to pay in the future and I would have been completely fine. It is so sad to see that they can easily take your money every month, increase your monthly premium each year, and then deny your claims and pay close to NOTHING. This is not the first time they have disappointed me however. Obviously, I was upset about the increases in monthly prices each year but whatever, you cannot do anything about that especially if you want to ensure your pet has coverage (or so you think they would anyway), but I was grandfathered into 100% reimbursement along with a $200 deductible. Well, this recent and current policy, I was raised to a $500 deductible and unable to keep my $200 one.. It is very clear that they do not care much about your pet or about your financial situations/the reason why you prefer to pay for coverage. Again, I am really saddened to know my money that I worked so hard for is wasted and gone, for nothing. I had to pay the entire bill and the little sixty something exam fee they did cover, it went toward my big $500 deductible anyway (LOL!). Please - take this from someone who has been with FIGO for years, paid tons of money in premiums and NEVER used them within that time period up until this year....SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR ENERGY!!! Put away some money every month (or every paycheck) toward an emergency vet fund for yourself (as if you were paying a monthly premium, only to yourself). This way, when you have a vet bill to pay, you will have this money already saved. Another option, get CARE CREDIT.. You never want to invest in something that you will forever be uncertain about. I pay for FIGO insurance and I get close to nothing in return from them. Absolutely terrible.. still in shock that I am at a loss. I really did have high hopes for this company and their services but I must have been sadly mistaken. Just to reiterate : SAVE YOUR TIME and YOUR MONEY.

5f91fa6c798e6f0aa0ac2fe8,False,False,"I don’t know where to start. We adopted a 4 year old English Bulldog earlier in the year. The poor dog was living in a van, rescued by a  local bulldog group and shuffled between foster homes all his life until we found each other. 
From past pet ownership
history I told myself years ago that if I ever get another pet I will have pet insurance on him/her. 
After 2 days of research and comparison to other pet insurance companies I decided to go with Figo... honestly, never thinking that I would need it. I chose a premium policy with a $500 deductible and 100% reimbursement and no annual claim cap at $62/month. 
Now the health problems began to arise...Less than 4 months after adopting Tobi he began to walk with instability and seemed to fall over when trying to lay down.  Noticeably after that he began losing the use of his back legs and then shortly after that his front legs began to give out.  In less than a weeks time he was not able to stand up by himself or stand up without assistance at all.  
I took him to our long-time family vet and upon review it seemed that his condition was severe, and the treatment that he required was beyond their scope of service so I was referred to a local animal hospital ( an animal hospital, not just a Vets office).

Long story short.... after X-rays, MRI’s and a spinal tap my poor boy had lesions on his brain and on his spinal cord at the C-1 & 2 vertebrae.  His condition worsened and the neurologist made one last attempt to treat him with a chemotherapy drug.  The treatment worked and Tobi was released from the hospital after a long weeks stay.  

The final bill was over $12,000 dollars!!!

I filed the claim, which is such an easy process with Figo and submitted all the requested paperwork.  
Here I am thinking that I’ve paid less than $200 in total insurance premiums and am now asking for a $12k reimbursement.  
There was no argument, no nit-picking or any challenge to my claim.  It was paid in a timely manner based on my policy coverage and terms.  ( I really thought that my wife was going to have to sell a kidney to pay off the bill but thankfully that didn’t happen. J/K )
I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Figo based on the following:
-Customer service
-Policy types and flexibility
-Competitive rates
-Easy of claim filing
-Overall satisfaction.

It is very obvious that they are doing some kind of promotion with new customers in a bid to change consumers negative views about them, but DO NOT BELIVE IT! Soon these reviewers will see and be sickened like I am.  I have trusted and loved this insurance company for far too long only to be treated in return with yearly price increases, decreases in coverage, and denials in coverage at every turn! Their new revised policies description of a “pre existing condition” very literally states “A condition may be considered Pre-existing: whether or not it was specifically diagnosed by a veterinarian, whether or not it was treated by a veterinarian, is in remission at the time of application, is seasonal in nature even if in remission at the time of application, is currently or previously being controlled by medication(s) ect” it goes on an on. I challenge you to find something they could not find a loop hole for to make it pre existing when their new policy actually states it can be considered pre existing whether or not it was diagnosed or treated by your veterinarian. Are you joking me?  My dogs were both rescue animals age 2 and 1 when they started on insurance so they already had some previous vet history. This is not a good thing when this company is looking to connect dots that don’t even exist to make everything pre existing, and no amount of Dr’s notes or info will change their minds. Also, it is ridiculous to say you are “transparent” with your price increases and subsequent coverage decreases by sending you email saying “theese are your renewal options” and if you don’t like it, well, too bad. They could care less and don’t let them make you think any different. I have a two year and four year old dog and pay over $140 per month. I can’t imagine how much this would be costing me if my dogs were seniors. Also, your options are basically to either renew with them or just hope your dog doesn’t get ill, because now everything your dog has ever had or is ever even mentioned in the doctors personal notes ( insurance will get them, believe me) is a “pre existing condition”. They know they have you over a barrel and this is why they are getting away with these price Increases.

I've never had to file a claim, I happily accepted the reasonable increase to my premium in 2018 for my ""Senior"" Dog when he turned 8, and even chose to increase my coverage in 2019 just to be on the safe the side! 

This week I received an email notifying me my policy was up for renewal, but because Figo has recently changed underwriters my monthly premium has TRIPLED, my deductible has DOUBLED, and my reimbursement amount has gone down by 20%.  

The email they sent even says they think the increase of over 50% is unacceptable, however they are willing to do NOTHING about it. It literally reads: ""Since your upcoming policy will be underwritten by IAIC, not all coverages/plans or prices match exactly from your previous plan. However, your increase this year may exceed 50%, and we find this to be unacceptable. In order to make this transition easier for you and to find the best coverage available for a similar price with IAIC, we are providing you a recommended options""

??? Seriously???
The best possible option you could come up with was to triple what I was paying before with less coverage? If that's the going rate for the market then that's fine, I have no problem paying a fair price for a decent product. But as a business it is your responsibility to come up with a long term strategy to increase over time and not make your customers feel like they are being taken advantage of. An increase of that significance should happen in small increments over time and not triple over night. I have emailed my request to cancel my policy immediately and already signed up with a new provider who I will be happily paying $110 a month for the same coverage I had before with Figo.

5f0ddd583f06f20bb4b10ec6,False,False,"Figo is not a good pet insurance company and I wouldn't be comfortable recommending it to my friends and family. When I was first shopping for pet insurance I ran across a ton of negative reviews accusing Figo of doing a bait and switch, where the first year's policy is reasonably priced but then it doubles the next year. I asked a Figo customer service rep if that actually happened and she denied it. It was one of those situations where either the rep had been lied to or she was lying to me, neither of which is good. She recommended that I request a quote for my pet but aged one year older to see how my premium would increase after one year. That seemed fair, so i did that. The increase was from $48 to $54 and that seemed fair so I bought the policy. 

They messed up the first claim. They applied the office fee toward my deductible even though i hadn't paid for that option. I called them to let them know of the mistake. They were embarrassed, which is the correct response. It is embarrassing to be an insurance company and not know how to process your own claim. 

At some point during my first year, the company announced that they were changing underwriters because they got so many complaints about doubling premiums (guess that was true after all). When I moved from Phoenix, AZ to a small town in Minnesota and went to renew my policy, they wanted to increase my premium from $48 to $68. I called to ask why there was such a big increase and they said it was because I had moved and vet care is more expensive in my new location. In what universe is pet care more expensive in a small midwestern town than it is in ANY large metropolitan area? I HATE being lied to by companies so I found a new pet insurance company. Plus, the deductible increased from 1000 to 1500 and I lost some other benefits I cant remember right now, but they wanted more money for it.

 I cancelled my Figo account  and received an email confirming cancellation.  The next month they still charged me the premium. At that point I was in the middle of changing banks and had a minimal amount of money in my old bank acct, which was linked to Figo. The payment overdrew my bank account. They refused to cover the charges.

So ask yourself this... if you're in the middle of a medical emergency with your pet, who may be the love of your life, will you be able to trust a company that has repeatedly lied to you and been unable to follow their own claim procedures? Can you really trust them to be there for you and your pet in time of desperate need? I don't want to be in the position of having to choose to put down my pet because I cant afford the treatment because my pet insurance company can't get itself together. Me, I'll go with a company that's better established, doesn't outright lie to me, and knows what it's doing.

As in all businesses profit is the bottom line. But their customer service has also declined. ""Well, I'm not sure and Umm, I don't know"" now are standard responses.  The only exceptions have been my interactions with Susan, Anne, and to some extent Jenna. I was becoming very frustrated on the call with Jenna and dropped an F-bomb. I apologized more than once but I could ""feel"" her coldness through the phone.

5eadf204086b640954466efd,False,False,"When I first signed up with this company, I gave them stellar reviews; however, things have gone downhill. This company lured me in with very low rates for pet insurance for all 3 of my dogs. After 2 years there was a significant increase in premium that raised my cost by almost $200 a year. They explained it was due to my premiums being too low compared to the national average and they needed to be raised. At this point, my dog was sick and I just kept the insurance. The following year there wasn't a large increase and they assured me that they wouldn't have a significant increase like that again. Fast forward 3 years later and they have changed underwriters. Now my premium has increased by $10-$15 per dog, raising my premium by $380 a year. At renewal, the company hid this significant increase by lowering my dogs coinsurance from 80% to 70% without my authorization. They said they did this automatically to not have my premiums raise significantly. When I asked them to change my policy back to what I authorized (what I signed up for) I then saw this large increase to my insurance rates. Had I not read my declaration page very closely, I would not have noticed this small change to my policy and wouldn't have seen this increase in premium. This is being done during the covid-19 pandemic and most insurance companies are offering discounts to their clients. Figo, is changing your policy design without your consent to hide the insanely large increase to your premiums. This company uses unethical business practices to lure you in with very low rates, knowing that after 4 years your dogs will have been to the vet several times and anything your dog has been to the vet for,  another pet insurance company with not cover because it will be considered a pre-existing condition. Figo let me know that if I cancelled my policy, no other insurance company would cover my dogs cancer treatment.

5e5fbfa13c93ae0bc40fba0e,False,False,"I am so ashamed of myself for signing up for this pet insurance. I have been paying on my policy for almost a year. I needed to file a claim for my cat as she was throwing up. I took her to the vet hospital they really did not find anything wrong with her. They did give her some medicine as they felt she may be having a problem with defecating. My cat had this problem around 3 years ago but the vet did not find anything that was causing this. She said she may have eaten something that caused this. Of course, when I submitted my claim to FIGO they denied it as they stated that this was a precondition that was not covered. My total vet bill was $932. I agreed to the additional testing as I thought I was covered under this insurance plan. Big mistake!!!! When I called the lady would not provide me the legal address to provide to my attorney nor would she provide me anyone else to speak with. She stated that she was the only person in the office. I asked to speak with her manager and of course, they were not available. This is a typical insurance response when they do not want to payout. She kept tel me that they do payout for services and recently paid a $20,000 claim. HA HA HA, what was that the one claim for the year and this has been added to your script to defuse customers? Cats get sick and mine does about every 6 months or so but it passes. Their response was as follows:  ""Cat has a history of intermittent vomiting and constipation over the last 2 years. She has episodes about every 6 months where she will be straining to defecate and will produce either nothing or large dry fecal balls. She always vomits and cries during the days when she is sick.
Chronic intermittent vomiting, constipation, anorexia, +/- diarrhea"" But this is not covered as they consider this as a precondition prior to taking out my policy. Again, they have no intention of paying anything out and they expect their payment every month on time. Think the only way you could get a claim is that it has to be a newborn with no problems and then maybe they will payout something but like most insurance companies they will find a loophole.

Follow up on their reply: please see how they act like they care but as you can tell this is a typical insurance companies response.

5e521b4f3c93ae0864a5b8d2,False,False,"First, when shopping for pet insurance you will find that Figo, hands down, provides THE most flexibility in policy customization. Once you select your coverage level (yes there are options!) you can choose from several combinations of annual deductible, annual payout limit, and percentage of coverage. Figo is also one of the only (if not THE only) pet insurance companies to offer both an unlimited annual payout option and a 100% coverage option on claims (most max out at 90%). 

So let's talk claims... I have three cats and a dog and unfortunately have had to use my pet insurance on more than a few occasions (no worries they are all fine now). Simple. Basically just upload images of the bill then wait... and not for long. The quickest turnaround between submitting a claim and confirmation of coverage was 14 minutes. No $h*t. I think the longest may have been one business day. Then just a few days until the money hits your account. 

One more thing - cost. I have spent the time and have done the research on I believe every pet insurance company in existence (I can spend time doing that because I have no human children). Figo has the most competitive rates for the coverage. Period. 

I know this is a very wordy review but there are very few things that I am this passionate about. I am very grateful for this insurance and tell everyone about it that will listen. I could not recommend it more.

5e3e07c13c93ae04c0dceef7,False,False,"IF I could give this company zero stars I would. I am a veterinarian and have insured my personal pets with figo for the past 3 years.  Yes the price hikes are outrageous, however Fine go did cover the cost whenever my pets were sick and needed additional care above what I could provide for them (which is a lot, I had 3 older pets).  My problem with this pet insurance began when my beloved Winnie passed away unexpectedly due to complications from chemotherapy in July 2019.  I was devastated.  I admit it took me a long time (6months) to submit the paperwork for reimbursement as I was grieving (still am). 
Figo refuses to reimburse me due to the fact that Winnie’s policy annually renewed on July 11 (even though I paid faithfully every month).  Figo claims I had 90 days after july 11 to make a claim on the previous annual policy.  When I finally submitted the claim in 12/2019 I only received payment for the July 17th bill.  I contacted figo two weeks later and was told they just did not scroll down and will process the two claims from July 8 & 9th.  Another two weeks go by and still no reimbursement.  I contacted figo again and they FINALLY explained that they are not going to reimburse me because the annual renewal date of July 11, (you only have 90 days after that to make a claim from the previous policy year).  First,  of all we are talking about a matter of 3 days and I always made the monthly payments.  I would understand if I canceled the insurance than asked for reimbursement.  Second, I feel like they strung me along by initially saying they just didn’t scroll down on the email and see the additional claims.  Third, agent Shea kept saying the underwriter would not let them pay.  Well if that’s true why did they string me along.  Fourth, I have submitted claims a few months after and it was never a problem, I was never advised there was a time limit for claims.  Winnie happened to get sick at the end of her policy and that’s why Figo does not want to pay, that’s duplicitous.  If she had gotten sick a few days later this would not have been an issue and my claim would have been reimbursed.  
I love my pets & insured them to get the best care possible without financial limitations, I never asked for reimbursement on the months I paid after Winnie’s death, it was the last thing I had to hold on to.  Additionally Figo will not let me appeal the decision, but would not explain why.
SHAME ON YOU FIGO for not allowing your customers to grieve over the loss of their pet (Winnie was my first dog and like my child)!  Unfortunately I have to continue to use Figo for my two other pets (Nala & Bailey), they have too many diagnosed comorbidities to switch insurance companies as most pet insurance companies do not cover pre existing conditions.  
When I am ready to adopt a new dog I will be looking at other pet insurance companies such as pets best, trupanion or nationwide.  As previously stated I am a veterinarian and will not be recommending Figo pet insurance to clients.  I am also considering legal action!  BEWARE of figo pet insurance they are devious!  
******response to Figo Pet Insurance reply: According to your policy I have 6 months to submit a claim.  I didn’t realize figo would put in exceptions to their policy ie.  only 90 days to submit a claim from renewal policy period or 90 days after a pets death.  So I guess my pet can’t get sick at the end of the policy period.  Second you did not even address the fact that your agents strung me along with the first call regarding my claim & the fact that figo did not notify me that my claim was denied.  I feel I was strung along so I couldn’t make an appeal. Third it took a poor review for Figo to adhere to their own policy and reimburse me the money I paid on Winnie’s policy after her death.  Fourth, stop using the underwriter as a scapegoat, Figo picked the underwriter.

I noticed that Figo also has my policy effective date incorrect as 12/28/2019 when I had been a paying customer since 2018.. I'm assuming this is one of the reason why they try to state my dog's vet's visits as'pre existing' and refused to cover the fees. I've had a chat with my vet and she too was confident that the fees from the clinic should have been covered by most credential insurance providers.

I've had a terrible experience with Figo. It came highly recommended through a friend so I signed up and became a member in mid 2018. 

During Christmas 2019, my dog, who had been perfectly healthy all her life throughout all her vet visits, started coughing strangely and we found specks of blood on her snout. We quickly took her to the vet and had the clinic send the insurance claim for the veterinary bills.

The whole process took over 2 weeks with Figo closing, re-opening my claim, disappearing for days and requesting more and more my pet's previous records since her birth..
I managed to send them all the records from vets we had visited which clearly shows that *Karlie had no know issues.* 

And once all seems to be set, all my claims were denied and not a single cent was covered with Figo using 'pre-existing conditions' for all her expenses regarding this new symptom thatstarted in Dec 2019. I felt robbed knowing that my healthy dog has never had any issues before and having had Figo insurance for 2 years, they won't cover anything by claiming her condition was pre-existing while it was only discovered 2 weeks ago by the vet, after 1.5 years after being a Figo customer.

Got the policy with Figo and when the policy kicked in August  I took my puppy to the vet, and he had a heart murmur, some Pomeranian dogs have them, doctor said it could be nothing but it could lead to something worst or it could go away, anyway this is a congenital disease. Unfortunately it led to an an enlarged heart and had to go to an emergency vet on October 25th. I also payed more so I can have coverage for vet bills, and they refused to PAY!!!! My Pomeranian has to have surgery and they didn’t want to pay also because they said It fell under the 14 day no Illness period or some crap like that. They       asked every document they we had for our dog. And they didn’t want to cover. On their website they have misleading information saying that they could have exceptions if the certified vet would send a letter But his was a congenital disease which this was!!!! also they told me that on the phone. THEY SHOULD COVER CONGENITAL DISEASES which this was the Case. My vet and the cardiologist send a very convincing letter and and she also spoke with them on the phone A COUPLE OF TIMES they REFUSE TO PAY as well as this point  all I wanted is my puppy to have surgery and I had to put it on my credit card. I had to pay more than $6000 which I’m still trying to pay. My dog passed away in surgery On Nov 7th, we are still heart broken and we miss him every day. 
Figo when they replied denying to pay used a very normal language with no medical terms but, last email I got from them it FELT LIKE AN INSULT!!! They transformed the letter that the cardiologist and the vet send them to change a few thing now speaking with medical terms like PDA and stuff like that. They are full of crap turning tables on their favor. Even when my Vet from the specialty center and cardiologist called them and sent emails to them, they were looking always for a way out. They wanted to talk to the fist vet that detected the murmur trying to find contradictions but they couldn’t find any!!! They still denied to pay. I tell people I know about this and they have lost customers cause these are really messed up.

5c191a349d37800b401e840a,False,False,"I can honestly say without reservation that FIGO was the most important decision I made when we welcomed our two Yorkie puppies into our family.  We elected 100% coverage (an option not offered by most of not all of their competitors) for Cody and Lola. Throughout their first year as puppies they got into all types of trouble eating things they shouldn’t have and visits to the vet became more frequent than we’d like.  Every time we could get the treatment our pups needed without fear of not being able to afford the vet care.  
This past year we were devastated to find out Cody had a liver condition that would shorten and eventually take his life.  To get this news about our 2 year old baby was indescribable. We did our research and found that Animal Medical Center was the best place to go for the surgery Cody required. All in through the diagnostic tests, MRIs, CT scans, ICU stay and surgery the cost was to be over $10,000. Because of our FIGO coverage we could get the best care Cody needed and give him a fighting chance. I contacted FIGO and explained the situation and not only did they give us the confidence and pre-approval that the surgery would be covered they genuinely cared.  Mackenzie at FIGO followed up frequently checking on Cody and wishing him well. FIGO also paid the claim a few days after Cody’s surgery 
I can report that 2 weeks post-op Cody is almost fully recovered and will now live a full and healthy life. We owe our Cody’s life to the surgeons at AMC and without our FIGO coverage we would not have been able to save our puppy without financial hardship.

Most claims I have submitted have been approved and the coverage is decent. There was one claim that was denied, because my 3 month old puppy supposedly had the illness (Giardia) before the coverage period began. Since Giardia is considered 'curable', if she goes a year without symptoms, the illness will be removed from the 'preexisting' conditions list. I have found the customer service over the phone to be good (fast, knowledgeable, and genuine care). So far I would recommend FIGO; get it while your pet is young to make sure there are no 'preexisting' conditions that get excluded.

Figo offers many coverages not available through other insurance. The reviews from users and review sites were also impressive. However no amount of research will matter if the company makes the claims process difficult or refuses to pay. Well I am happy to report that Figo has the easiest claims process, you simply take a picture of your receipt in the app and fill in a few details and your done. As far as processing and payment. Figo far exceeded my expectations. I have filed 4 claims, all were processed in less than a week and 2 were processed the same day. All 4 claims have been either applied towards my selected yearly deductible or paid out and the money direct deposited. I took my pup to the vet Wednesday and on Friday the money is in ny account. During claim submission it stated it could take up to 2 weeks which I felt was fair and reasonable but to process and payout in 2 days is extraordinary service. I didn't have to fight or wait.

5b907fdb8c83fd0bd00858c5,False,False,"FIgo, Figo, Figo...

It has truly been a blessing to have found an insurance company that really cares about and values dogs over profit. 

My family started the journey with Figo several years ago when we insured our first two dogs; Paisley & Skittles. From the very beginning we were treated with respect and charged fair prices. 

Earlier this year, Paisley became very sick and had to be treated at multiple emergency locations which ultimately culminated with her having to receive an emergency surgery that would save her life. I think that few dog owners ever really stop to think about just how expensive medical treatment can be for their loved pets. We certainly had not thought about it, and of course we had some reservations when it came to our experiences with human insurance companies. Needless to say, the medical bill for this treatment was extraordinarily expensive, but I'm happy to say that Figo was there for us and has since been there for our other pet; Skittles when she recently became ill.

My wife and I now have two other pets in the family; Ellie & Bailey and they are also insured with the best company in town. I know that should anything ever happen to them, Figo has my back, and to anyone who's considering this company for your loved ones, I highly recommend it and promise that it will be the best decision that you will make for your pet.

 Figo offers to waive the 6 month waiting period on any knee injuries if your vet examines the knees and finds them healthy. So I had my vet have examine my dog, and he wrote on her chart that he had examined all 4 legs including the joints and soft tissues, there were no abnormalities or indication of any problem. I uploaded this via the (very user friendly) app, and notified the company that I had done so. 

They responded very quickly which was good, but I was told that the veterinarian was supposed to say he has examined her knees - so by saying that he had examined 4 legs and found them all healthy, I hadn't fulfilled the criteria to have the 6 month waiting period waived. I found it almost funny, how many legs do they think my dog has?

Although this is an easy problem to fix, it's left me very concerned that there is no common sense approach and that if I ever have to make a claim I would risk having denied it based on loopholes and traps in the policy wording.

When I called to see what was going on, they would tell me that they needed more documentation. The first time, the info was actually already in the pet cloud, but they ""overlooked"" it. Three more repeats of this cycle (no communication, me calling, them asking  for more information, me supplying the info) ensured. Finally, a determination was received from the company that no stomach issues would ever be covered for my dog as his stomach issues were a pre-existing condition.

Our English Bulldog had to have a surgery to rectify his soft palate.

4-6 weeks later, we finally get an email the claims been closed with zero payment. We file and appeal and the doctor wrote a letter advising why the ""loud breathing"" they said was a preexisting symptom, in fact had no set link to the diagnosis. 
This appeal was filed February 12th of 2018 and we were advised it would be within 30 days. Well at day 33 I had heard nothing and sent them an email and 3 days later, get an email that they need the original vet records (which they should have absolutely already had). So I get them sent over and email them to make sure they got them. 1 week later still have not heard anything so we call them and they advise they are still waiting on the records, so again we get them sent over. Another week of reviewing they finally close the claim again, zero payment.
Also within this entire claims process of waiting and going back and forth, they raised the monthly premium by almost double, so they were able to get even more money squeezed out of us, while they were going as slow as possible getting a resolution.

5aaa7880d5a57004d4e9c120,False,False,"(posted on March 15th 2018)
I am a FIGO customer for nearly a year now. I'm transcribing below an e-mail/complaint I sent a week ago to their customer support, to which they didn't bother replying yet. I'll let you make your own judgement.

'I submitted claim # (XXX) under policy # (XXX) on January 27th 2018 for veterinary cost incurred on January 25th 2018.

My claim was closed today (March 8th 2018) and was denied in its full amount.

I understand that with any insurance policy there are exclusions. The reason for denying my claim was given as code 18: 'Denied due to specific exclusion in the policy terms and conditions'.

I wanted to investigate further what were the specific exclusions in my policy that resulted in the denial of this claim. I therefore chatted with FIGO customer support.

I was told that routine/preventive treatments are not covered, which I had read before in the FAQ section of FIGO's website. When I asked for documentation enumerating which treatments FIGO considers to be routine/preventive care, I learned, to my great surprise, that there was no such list.

This is deeply unsettling (...) FIGO cannot simply say that routine/preventive care is not covered without specifically describing which treatments are considered routine/preventive. FIGO customers or even prospective customers have the right to know this information. By not sharing this information, FIGO can ultimately deny any claim by stating it pertains to routine/preventive care. The customer has no appealing power because he/she does not know what routine/preventive care really means.

By omitting such apparently harmless information, FIGO is able to dictate the rules of any policy or claim as it wishes, leaving the customer completely powerless. This is a shameful strategy to extort premium payments from people without providing them with any transparency about the commercial agreement they sign off with FIGO.

I would like to stress that my complaint is not about my claim (...) but about the general conduct of FIGO, revealing bad faith towards its clients.'

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(posted on April 6th 2018)
Updating my review above (posted on March 15th 2018), and not for good reasons...

Just a few hours after I posted the review above, FIGO finally got back to me, not just by e-mail but also by posting a reply to my original review as you can see here. It's sad to see that after a whole week of complete silence regarding my complaint, a simple, basic trick from my side (posting the same complaint on an online review website) triggered a response in just a few hours, even though the response didn't change anything at all. This shows total lack of respect for customers. FIGO is clearly more concerned about public image than with its customers.

Also, their response was: 'Per our policy, preventive care is deemed as any treatment, service or procedure, including but not limited to physical examinations, medications, surgeries, inoculations or laboratory procedures, for the purpose of prevention of illness or injury or for the promotion of general health, where there has been no illness or injury.' If you think about it, they're playing with semantics. When the policy says 'any treatment, service or procedure, including but not limited to...' the possibilities remain open to adding infinite new items to the list of treatments, services or procedures in question. That's what 'not limited to' means.

But the cherry on top of the cake was that just a couple of weeks after I got this unsatisfactory reply from FIGO, I was informed of my policy renewal premium: $757.20. It went from $348.45 in the first year to $757.20 for the second year! This is a 217% increase!!! I had seen reviews from other customers warning about their outrageous increases in premium, but this is absolutely unacceptable! What a rip off!

I was told to sit tight, which I did. However in Feb 2018 I got a callback from their claims department and was told that they are closing my claim due to lack of attention on my end. They kept claiming they sent me emails that the vet notes I sent were not actual vet notes or what they needed. I told them I did not receive those emails. They then insist I don't know how to use emails. I'm sorry, but that's not only rude but incorrect, I happen to make software for a living.
I called them back and asked if I can provide certain records, and was told by their CS department that ""they don't know"". This was about 24 hours before they suddenly closed my claim. 
The same day, I emailed them and I told them to give me back the remainder of my balance and just cancel my insurance. 6 days passed, no response. I then called them again, and they finally cancelled my policy. They wasted my $500 and several hours of talking to them. I patiently waited for their end to work for 2 months, but was punished instead.

==== RESPONDING TO FIGO ====

Thank you for responding to this review. I already cancelled my policies so having someone reach out is moot at this point. I am hoping my refund will not take long.

I appreciate your thorough response, you courteous presence online is what drew me to your service.

But for those who are shopping around, let me post the details of my claim.

9/12/17: Joined Figo. Paid $605.02 and $579.31 for my dogs.

12/12/2017 : Filed a claim of about $118 for one of my dogs.

12/15/2017 : Got an automated email about them transferring things in-house.

01/19/2018: Chatted with Figo. I initiated the contact since there was no feedback from them. Was told that claim will be finalized next week.

02/01/2018: Chatted with Figo.  I initiated the contact since there was no feedback from them. They said they're still waiting on medical records.

02/06/2018: Chatted with Figo.  I initiated the contact since there was no feedback from them. They said claim will be processed within two days.

02/07/2018: Got a call from Figo saying they are closing my claim if I can't provide certain medical records. They said they need the records within 48 hours otherwise they will close my claim. They had weeks to tell me this, but then surprise me with such short notice with what they need.

02/07/2018: Called Figo, asked what I can provide to help my claim, aside from submitting what I have via cloud. The customer service rep said that the claims department will call me back the before closing my claim, since I submitted documents via the pet cloud. The customer service rep was patronizing.

2/07/2018: Emailed to cancel my policy. The call earlier was very unsettling. For a mere $118 dollars I'm being given such extreme run-around.

This is also after numerous RUDE calls. They want to tlk over you, they forget you are the client. I cant waste any more energy on this company, a manager finally called me, I'm not bothering to call back, her message noted their cancellation policy, really? Not the fact that I was lied to numerous times, I WAS..
By the way, they miraculously received EVERYTHING from my Vet (I also sent it, not sure what they are talking about) a few days after I cancelled my policy, so now my claims are null & void. Do not use this company, they are spin masters and amazing at it. Pls pls, believe the bad reviews, and there are many, everywhere.

Figo's customer service representative, Jennifer, was so far above and beyond all others in her expert knowledge of both the policy options, coverage, and also of veterinary practices.....she was just very impressive.  I didn't feel like I was speaking to a phone operator who had been trained in a ""sales pitch""....but rather someone who is truly expert in her field.  The Figo coverage options vs. premiums are better than all other companies I researched.  So I signed up with Figo after Jennifer spent considerable time on the phone answering my questions.  She is so impressive because she knows what she's talking about, doesn't sugar coat anything with a ""smooth sales pitch"", but just provides hard fact information in an exceptionally pleasant and accommodating manner.  But the true ""meat of the matter"" of an insurance company and chosen policy.....is their claims process and payment of claims.  Well, as luck would have it, (or lack thereof) with this new puppy......some Advil capsules spilled on the floor late in the evening on Labor Day weekend.......and although it was thought that all caps were properly picked up off the floor......a little while later, the puppy was found with an Advil in her mouth......and no telling if she had ingested more than what was found in her mouth or not.......seriously? At midnight on a Fri nite of a holiday weekend? ......off to the ER clinic we went.  There was a 5 day waiting period for accidents on the Figo policy.  Can't believe my good fortune, that this accident happened 7 days after signing up with Figo.  You can be sure that ER clinic visits on a holiday weekend and the additional testing needed were quite a significant expense.

5921a24420b79f0b24f06969,False,False,"After 16 years of excellent health with our beloved cat she came down with an acute case of pancreatitis. As she was aging, and that incident cost us $6000 out of pocket, we decided to finally get insurance for her. We were concerned no provider would take us due to her age as several do not, but luckily Figo did. 

We were then extremely grateful when we got insurance as her health continued to decline over the next eight months, and we recently had to say goodbye to her. While Figo did not cover her existing pancreatitis, they covered everything else that happened the next 8 months. Which included chronic inflammatory bowel disease, an acute anxiety issue due to an alley cat, a urinary tract infection, a kidney tumor and finally our loss of her and the cremation process. 

We were reimbursed nearly all of the money of the claims we had submitted (minus a pancreatitis flare up), and only paid in a tiny fraction of that total dollar amount in monthly fees. I found the website and submission process to be easy once I figured out it would save time to always submit lab/exam notes with the invoice. The turn around time for claims processing and getting reimbursed was also surprisingly fast. 

On top of all of that they were incredibly empathetic, sympathetic and gracious with our loss. They made the emotionally painful process of closing the account nurturing and supportive. They even sent us a hand signed card several weeks later. 

Should we choose to get another furry friend in the future, we will start off with Figo from the beginning. I can't recommend them enough.",5,"Easy to use, generous benefits and very supportive",0,,2017-05-21T14:20:52.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/figopetinsurance.com?page=82

After going into debt when my labradoodle puppy ate a sock last summer, I decided I needed to get pet insurance for him and my older labradoodle. I shopped around and the cost vs. coverage seemed the best with Figo. It's very cheap for my puppy, but much higher for my older dog because he was almost 12 when I got it for him. 

Well the decision paid off! This spring my older dog got some senior issues that has required multiple visits to specialists and an overnight stay in the Emergency Vet and Figo has been a lifesaver!

58110fff19774d05fc875a30,False,False,"We got a new puppy and the vet recommended pet insurance. I was very skeptical and, after reading reviews of pet insurance companies, I didn't feel much better. I was about to give up when I found Figo. The website, sign up process, and pricing were straight forward and they promised to make pet insurance simple. I also liked that all of their documents and processes were online via the Pet Cloud and seemed easy to use. After reading some positive reviews, I went ahead and signed up (still somewhat skeptical).

Unfortunately, exactly one week and one day after we signed up for Figo, we got the ""opportunity"" to give it a test run when our puppy accidentally ingested a naproxen tablet. We took her to the vet expecting that they would induce vomiting and we would go home only to find out that the pill could be fatal. She was admitted to the hospital and spent three days and two nights in their care. Every day, when the hospital billing coordinator would call with the financial update, I crossed my fingers hoping that Figo would be as easy to work with as promised.

When the puppy was discharged, I logged into Figo's Pet Cloud and completed my claim in minutes (literally, it took less than 5 minutes). While waiting for a response, the nice people at Figo even sent my pup a get better soon card! A week after I submitted my claim, I got a response from Figo (accompanied by a call to ensure that I understood the details) and am thrilled to report that the vast majority of our bill was covered! There were no surprises as we knew our deductible and co-pay amount and, when I called to ask a question, I received a quick and helpful response. 

Based on our experience thus far, I highly recommend Figo Pet Insurance to anyone who wants some extra reassurance for their furry friends.

More significantly though, as anyone who has ever filed an insurance claim knows, the claims process is usually not the most pleasant experience between a consumer and the insurer. But I have found that Figo has turned that notion on its head. Claims are incredibly easy to file, amazingly quick turnaround time is also a big plus. What really clinched it for me was the customer service reps. They are not only friendly, courteous and super helpful, some of them know oodles about pet health, all of which makes every call a great experience. I cannot find any reason to go back to the old insurance model, especially when I can do everything from my iPhone.

At first I was a little hesitant with signing up on FIGO.  Everything I read about FIGO and what they cover sounded almost too good to be true for the price I was quoted at. 
 
     We decided to give it a go and even ended up doing the 6 month waiver on knee related injuries for Sven just because we were already at our vet for Zazu's first round of vaccinations.  I could not believe it, but Sven ended up tearing his ACL just this past week; about three months into our policy start date.  Since we had his knee's waived everything is covered!!  The visit was covered and the surgery is going to be covered to!  Also, the fact that FIGO's staff is so caring makes this entire process that much easier on us.  I filled a claim and three days later we were sent a get well soon card in the mail for Sven.  Every time I call FIGO, the first thing they ask is how Sven is doing.  The staff is amazing.

Further, she has taken the time (on multiple occasions) to share her expert perspective as a vet tech---specifically about some issues relating to my furry beasts.

During the difficult time after my dog was diagnosed with hemangiosarcoma I found myself having to call them to make sure claims were received with all needed documentation. The lack of empathy and down right rudeness from their employee ***** was appalling. When my dog died I emailed them because I was too upset to call them and I never heard back. Finally I called them and ***** answered and I let her know I had sent an email saying my dog had passed away. Her response was ""I know, we got your email."" That is literally all she said and then hung up. No empathy or I'm sorry or even thanks for letting us know we closed your policy. This agent ***** has repeatedly been unhelpful and useless when I have called in the past but I never complained as I assumed she may have been having a bad day. I didn't realize until this interaction that she actually just may be a horrible human. I have since had my family switch over to 24 Pet Watch Insurance. I would never recommend Figo to anyone as they are not animal lovers and do not care about owners. They made an extremely difficult time even worse with their lack of support and empathy. This is my experience and may not be the same for everyone as this is a personal review. However, I am heartbroken and saddened at the lack of care and support provided by this company. I hope they record their calls so they can review this and see how horrible their agent treats their Customers.

They also state that they process claims in a timely manner. I found this to not be true at all. I would call asking for updates months after I submitted  a claim only to be told they had a backlog and didn't have a time frame. However this was also by the same agent who would never even ask for my claim information or wait for me to give details to which claim I was referencing. It took months to get a claim paid out and they were rude the entire way through.
