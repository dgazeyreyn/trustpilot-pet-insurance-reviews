65ebd482fe060717df9a7d9b,False,False,"Exactly what I feared would happen. You buy insurance and they find a way not to pay.

I purchased insurance in good faith. I followed the waiting period. On the first day coverage went into effect, my dog was diagnosed as having swallowed a foreign object. I did not wait to have my dog seen by the vet - I did not try to wait out the waiting period. You don't plan for this sort of thing and buy insurance weeks in advance.

The claims were denied because I told my vet my dog had a runny nose and eye discharge 2 days prior to the diagnosis by a vet. In other words, my claims were denied because I, as a lay person, observed cold/flu symptoms. I did not say she was bloated, I didn't say her stomach was tender. No gastric issues were observed until the day coverage went into effect - she threw up.
 
Any symptom will do to deny a claim. I believe a reasonable, non-veteranarian person would view the symptoms I saw as unrelated to a foreign object lodged in the small intestine. Luckily, the vet didn't rely on the symptoms I described.

The customer service wasn't great either. You have to initiate the appeal via writing. They won't initiate an appeal for you or let you speak with a supervisor.

I'll appeal, but my first encounter is exactly the opposite of the ""Welcome to our Pet Family"" message when I signed up and paid my premium. I do not believe they operate in good faith. Instead, they parsed the doctor notes and looked for a reason not to pay.

Unfortunately the past few years have been extremely disappointing. I am currently on hold with the company at this present time..it is now 48 minutes waiting on hold, and this is not unusual anymore, in fact I would say it is the norm.
I also have to follow up on claims, check the status.. question the reasons for denial, as they don't make sense. The most recent and very distressing incident occurred when I had to bring my16 year old cat to the emergency room on Christmas Eve,he was very ill and sadly the decision was made to euthanize him. I was extremely upset, my buddy was no longer with me. 
Later, I did submit a claim for the vet visit, I had to make approximately 10 phone calls as they kept sending emails that they didn't have enough information. They only reached out to the vet once until I requested them to. I found many of the interactions with the agents at the ASPCA to be less than one should expect, especially as they are speaking with customers who have sick animals. I am now on hold 55 mins!!!! Is this acceptable? I still do not have a satisfactory response for my claim, and they are still charging for insurance for my cat who has passed.

A week later I finally submitted the claim, not even bothering to look through any information on what would be covered and didn‚Äôt think twice. I put off cancelling the account (it made me too sad) but when I went on it was closed out for me which was a very big emotional relief for me.

Also‚Ä¶ if you paid for premium services when your pet is seen by a Veterinarian, but then decide to go to a less expensive plan, the entire previous claim made under the premium plan will be applied to the new less coverage plan even though you paid for premium services during your pets visit.

Sometimes it is easier to make a hasty opinion about a company, until you have to deal directly with them.  After dealing directly with ASPCA Pet Insurance, I had to come back to Trust Pilot, and make it right for my deceased furry family member.  They are a superb company, after you understand their process.  I respect and thank them for acknowledging my loss.

I submitted all of their medical records and then all of their regular bills so the insurance company would have the entire picture of each pet. Now, the excuse for not reimbursing a dime for any of the pets for any of their claims is ""other exclusions apply"". I am quite disappointed that I have spent so much money, thinking my 4 pets were covered. Our pets are a young dog, middle aged dog, and two middle aged cats. The claims have run from injured leg, skin infections, and illness. Nothing has been covered. One of our dogs just had surgery for an injury.

I had 2 claims come up during my time in having the pet insurance. I‚Äôm both instances, the issue is they will do everything in their power to deny the claim in the hopes you will give up trying to get reimbursed. In our cases, they kept saying that ‚Äúafter multiple attempts, they were unable to obtain the necessary medical records to process the claim.‚Äù So I went ahead and called my vet hospital to verify if the information was sent. Not only was the information was sent, but twice! After multiple frustrating calls to ASPCA, they were able to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the documents, but it always seemed to conveniently found a way to miss them or they claimed they don‚Äôt receive them. I think what really goes on is that if they can‚Äôt find a good reason to deny it medically, they will say they can‚Äôt obtain some record and just hope the person submitting the claim will give up.

When trying to handle it for the probably 20th time after three weeks of the issue still not being resolved, they asked me for proof of my emails and calls because they apparently have no record of them in their system. (this is a lie) Unfortunately, my email has an auto delete of five days for sent emails and I did not expect them to be so hard to work with (Its Aspca! They are supposed to care!) so I didn't save back ups. I even said I have screenshots of calls placed with my cellphone and their time frames, but because they apparently have ""no record"" of them and I didn't think I would have to record my own calls to them, that it won't be taken into account at all. This is now a mistake I will never forget. So now my coverage is inaccurate for what I wanted and needed and my cat will have insufficient insurance. Due to this issue I asked them to halt the processing for any new transaction for the annual payment while I check out my options with other carriers for my cat. They charged me anyway, directly after telling me I had a few weeks to decide and that they will halt a new transaction. Apparently it will take several weeks to get the funds back and I'll likely have to waste more time on hold and take off work to do so. Worst customer service I think I've ever experienced. 

To top it off, one of the changes I repeatedly tried to establish was the cancellation of one dog. My best friend of 14 years passed away and no one from this company would even give me the courtesy of replying to cancel her portion of the policy.  Each time on the phone when I mentioned this, the response I got was clinical and cold, as well as skeptical and asking me if I was ""sure that I'd emailed about it."" They charged my account to renew a policy for my dead friend after completely ignoring me and I didn't even get so much as a ""sorry."" To top this off, after never replying to my email about my girl, they sent me a condolences letter in the mail and *wait for it* STILL CHARGED ME for her policy, while still not even bothering to reply. Not only am I having to deal with all of this while grieving, but they treated me like an idiot as well. I had to throw a literal fit on the phone just to get the policy of my lost friend removed because it was passed the renewal date- through no fault of my own and with weeks of me trying to get them to follow through.

This company is fraudulent and shameful. I can't even begin to describe how much this increased my pain and distress while grieving. They made me feel stupid and taken advantage of in every possible way. And its not even very good insurance! Its bare bones with coverage with high as heck premiums. I'm tempted to look into a lawsuit for pain and suffering.",1,cold liars with zero accountability and an app that doesn't work,1,2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z,2023-10-15T15:36:50.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/aspcapetinsurance.com?page=31

It is a constant struggle to have ASPCA cover what is clearly listed in the policy, and when you submit an appeal, it further delays ALL processing.

 The normal processing times exceed a month when there are no extenuating circumstances.  I get frequent standard emails apologizing for the long delays, with ASPCA acknowledging the severe delays.  I just called about claims and the customer service rep was adamant they process claims in 7-10 business days, essentially telling me that he knew better about processing times instead of my actual experience and the acknowledgement from ASPCA via email apology.  

The the past few months, every time I call I‚Äôm given a different answer to the same question.  This is beyond frustrating and I am considering canceling my plan so I can give my dog the best care without the hassle and frustration every month.

Then when I went to pay, the site refused to accept any credit card I entered (it kept throwing a security code error, even when I input the security code correctly, and even when I tried multiple credit cards). I finally switched to using my bank account to pay just to complete the transaction. My bank account was promptly debited for the price of the insurance plan. Then, three days later I see I my bank account was debited a second time for a slightly different amount. I received absolutely no communication about this second charge. I e-mailed Customer Service and received no reply. I called Customer Service and they told me this was ""probably"" a change in premium and that I should ""probably"" be receiving a refund for the original premium. They told me to just wait a week and call back if I hadn't received a credit. This is a completely unacceptable answer -- I've been effectively charged twice, with the money taken directly out of my bank account -- and no one knows anything.

I bought through broker as I already had been working them prior to deciding on ASPCA.  I bought policy on 7/13 so still in waiting period, but learned that there was a more cost effective Deductible with 100% reimbursement that is not found without calling and asking for the quote. On 7/18, four days after my purchase the representative was very nice but could not change or adjust my policy without cancelling and starting all over with new policy. I was a bit disappointed but decided to leave the policy as originally purchased, and was told I can change next year. So the only reason for 4 stars as they would change my original purchase. 

 I post this mostly to say CALL and speak to someone and ASK for ALL your options deductibles, reimbursement amounts, etc. as all are not on website. I missed finding on a the brokers website also as it seems the only way I could have found was to select $1000 deductible then see the 100% reimbursement amount come up.  Otherwise their site also shows a 90% max reimbursement for ASPCA. Very tricky if a first time shopper.  Just know that you may have to wait till policy renewal to change or maybe even need the policy re-written to make a change.

64a37603947ab5597b725087,False,False,"I adopted a dog from the local SPCA and immediately purchased a policy through ASPCA Pet Health Insurance. My new dog somehow injured his right shoulder, starting as a small scratch turning into an open wound requiring a visit to the vet hospital. My adoption agreement included an one-time no fee wellness exam which I used for his visit. A couple of weeks later he developed a serious skin condition in a different area that he would scratch at obsessively. This began with a small area on his neck that seemed manageable. A day or so later his neck started to swell and the skin was terribly inflamed to the point of concern. I called the vet hotline and spoke with someone who after hearing my description of the issue suggested we go to the hospital. An appoint was made for the next day. During that night my dog had done serious damage to himself an area the size of a plum had erupted and became an ugly open wound. Over the next 3 weeks we had been to the hospital almost every other day because none of the medical staff could figure out the cause and the wound continues to worsen. I hadn't had this dog a month and a half and he was sick with no understanding why. Although I had adopted the dog from the same organization that was treating him I ultimately spent over $2000 in less than a month. Each visit to the vet was no less than $300 and as much as $575. I am retired and collect Social Security benefits of just over $1700 each month. Fortunately I have a medical specific credit card that could be used for vet care. As the charges for each visit was growing into the hundreds of dollars, I shared with the hospital staff my financial capacity was quickly becoming an issue I could not continue to fund. Even though I adopted this dog only a couple of week prior to his developing a critical need for medical attention from the very organization I was not offered any sort of financial relief. The day I brought this dog into my home I promised him I was 100% committed to being his loving forever human. Each visit to the vet over these couple of weeks would wreck havoc on my heart and soul as I would be desperate to find answers for how to ease his discomfort along with having to hand over hundreds of dollars over and over. 
My total and profound disappointment with this insurance company came after I had submitted claims for the care my dog received. I did not submit a request for the injury to his should for the first and second visit. The first had been comped and I paid the $200 plus for the follow up reexam. So what this insurance company does is deny the claim for treatment of the wound on his neck. This insurance company asked for the dogs medical records, which I immediately supplied to them for review. Although each situation my dog was facing were two completely different issues on completely different areas of his body, but because his first injury was inside the 14 waiting period. I did not ask them to reimburse any amount toward the first. I submitted claims for the treatment received for the problems that were well outside the 14 wait period. This insurance company decided they would not be responsible for reimbursement of any amount having assigned their code 51 pre-existing condition to my claim.
I have concluded this insurance company is a greedy, uncompassionate and misleading collective of people a scam willing to take the premium I pay in good standing every month. When I was up against a crisis that was emotionally devastating and financially unmanageable asking for their supports they basically inform me that they love my money, that I am a fool for ever thinking they had any intention of attempting to make me even the tiniest bit whole. 
I've given everyone more money than I have because I care greatly about my dog's well being and am fully committed to his care. In the end, this insurance company let me know that I was stupid for thinking I was being a responsible human to this rescued dog by sending them money every month. 
This insurance company is a scam and I am a sucker for putting my faith in them. 
My dog has completely recovered and I am truly grateful and a small bit relieved. I have lived on peanut butter and water for the last two weeks because I didn't have money to feed both me and my dog after giving hundreds and hundreds of dollars towards his medical bills.
I have decided this insurance company is not a place that I believe deserve my time or attention and have spent days trying to find how to cancel my policy with them through their member portal. I am quite sure if the only way to cancel a policy is speaking with anyone at this insurance company by phone someone would experience complete emotional collapse.

Update-after filing this complaint on Trustpilot, the company NOW wants to talk. I requested calls to my veterinarian and myself but there was no reply/response.

They cannot blame the pandemic, because customer service has been declining for longer than that. They recently changed the website one more time and now hardly ever works, overall the site is buggy. Now, the claim submission form is super long and takes double the time with all the clicks and odd navigation, and when you finally reach the end of it, the site acts up and you cannot submit it and it loses the info. When we call, the new phone tree is torture if you are lucky to survive, you still need to wait at least 15 min to talk to someone.

Which honestly, is quite an understatement. When I knew I was in trouble was when they would not cover my girls double patella surgery.  They kept insisting she was a purebred because that breed was prone to that, they don't cover it.  She was not.  Once that was fixed, then they said they wanted the last 2 years of her medical records. I did that.  Then they dug deeper from my vet and found from when she was a little puppy, that a vet said she thought she had weak patellas and to keep an eye on it. BAM, that's all they wanted and my surgery was not covered. That was AFTER I was told they only go back 2 years. I appealed and lost.  Then both my dogs ended up with liver issues later and need liver medication for the rest of their life,  or they will die.  They wouldn't cover it because the medicine is a supplement. And the icing on the cake? They both had Cushings (one passed on now) which is a lifelong disease. I knew I needed help with this! And I have the Continuing Care policy as well. Here is the horrible thing.  You have a ""lifelong"" limit. Mine is over,  so now I'm paying out of pocket for her expenses on her Cushings and anything that goes with it.

I also recently submitted my first four claims. Naturally they accepted my own money towards the deductible but when it comes to ASPCA insurance covering anything my intuition was correct in that everything is going to be considered a pre-existing condition. For example, my pet received an antibiotic injection and they stated this was injection was not reimbursable because it was for a pre-existing condition. When I questioned why the injection portion of the claim was not reimbursable they stated it was due to a pre-existing condition. They stated it was due to my pet having tartar which could lead to gingivitis even though gingivitis wasn‚Äôt listed in my pet‚Äôs record. An antibiotic injection is not given for tartar! Pet insurance in general is a total waste of money, you‚Äôre paying money every month to have useless insurance and for ASPCA insurance to deny this claim is ridiculous, especially since there was nothing in the medical record leading to a pre-existing condition.

I had my cats insurance from @2012 to 2019. In December of 2019 at a vet visit the office noted we should consider prescription cat food for developing kidney disease. When we took him back to the vet a few months later the vet took blood work and recommended we start a medicine for his kidneys. When I submitted the bill it was denied and I was told it was a continuing illness from the previous year and was not covered. I still don‚Äôt understand the denial. Six years without a claim and then told it was not covered. We have been paying for meds and now infusions three years later and have no insurance coverage. I do not think the very limited coverage was worth much once a problem develops in an  older cat. Money wasted for six years. I thought I had him covered for catastrophic illnesses but evidently it all has to happen in the same year.

It's a French Bulldog and they tend to have digestive issues and he was fine until Sept and had a bout with his stomach and we call and could not get into see the vet until Dec whcih at that point they prescribed about 4 meds and stated to keep him on his strict diet  which we have. Our bill was $336 and once I submitted the claim they needed med records which the vet provided and at that point they decide it was ""pre-existing condition"" which is a crock of ""you know what "" I called and got the standard well he a condition back in May so unfortunately it's not 180 days from the 
  ""pre-existing condition"" so we can't take anything off your deductible and all the meds will not be covered.

63bf1f112338b6d417b70c4a,False,False,Unfortunately due to the heartless decision of this so called insurance company we are having to make the tough choice right now of whether to put our cat Woody down. This cat has been a part of our young family for 2.5 years. We took him to the hospital back in September due to a problem that he had with one of his knees causing him not be able to walk. He also had to have surgery at that time to remove a blockage in his  bladder. We went into a lot of debt to pay for that surgery. We got this insurance at that time to protect us in case something else came up. A month later we were told by our vet that completely unrelated to what we were informed before with his knees Woody now has degenerate hip disease. We submitted a claim with this so called insurance company who then informed us that they are unable to cover it due to preexisting conditions. Somehow hips are closely enough related to knees that that our cat's prior incident was considered a pre-existing condition?? If you don't have this insurance already don't start it. If you do cancel it. They will find every excuse they can to not cover the care your pet needs. I would advise that the Better Business Bureau investigate the fraudulent practices and standards of this so called insurance company. Protect you and your pets by staying out and getting out of this insurance company.

One of the most significant selling points for me was to have pet insurance through an organization that handles pets only. Not to mention an organization that specializes in animal rescue. 
The prices are reasonable, and the options to add to your policy are excellent. Also, knowing my dog has a pre-disposition for hip dysplasia gives me a piece of mind that I won‚Äôt go into debt with veterinarian bills, even if he never develops it. 
I had a former pet that was my best friend. She got melanoma on her tongue, which, if undetected, would have killed her quickly. As you can imagine, the vet bills were astronomical, and so was the aftercare. 
When I got my new puppy, knowing he was pre-disposed to certain conditions because of the breed, I did not want to go through the financial hardship I went through with my former pup.

Filing claims was/is easy, you get reimbursed quickly, the company website and the layout of your online account for the plan is intuitive , everything just works. Fast forward to today and, well, I'm pissed. Before choosing ASPCA 2 years ago, I did a lot of research on the different pet insurance companies which included reading reviews and pouring over the fine print for each offered plan. I understood before purchasing a plan with ASPCA that premium rates go up each year per pet and this is true with every insurance company. What I did not anticipate is how much those increases would be and dear god its thievery. The first increase for my dogs plan ended up being +$29.11 a month. The second and most recent one? +$54.56 extra per month. Are-You-Freaking-Kidding-Me? An extra $600 a year. What about my cats you might ask? For their first increase it was about +$5 for one and +$9 for the other. This price increase is ridiculous and when you look at how much I've paid ASPCA since using them and how much I've gotten back its sickening. Now I get it, insurance is just like gambling and you always take a chance. But a price increase of almost %29 in one year? Give me a break. Pure Robbery. Needless to say, I will be canceling my plan.
Oh! What happens if you try to reach out to customer support about the increases? They tell you, ""just reduce your coverage and you'll save on premiums"".

This was an annual, routine dental cleaning in which this insurance company DENIED my claim. I filed a claim because the teeth extractions were unexpected. It was only found out through the procedure that my dogs teeth needed to be pulled, there was no way the vet knew that beforehand because the vet even told me they wouldn‚Äôt know if or how many teeth would need to be pulled.

62e03d824c35e69ec51a9dd6,False,False,"I do NOT recommend ASPCA Pet Insurance and encourage you to exercise caution. Their claim that ""an illness is no longer pre-existing after 6 months"" has numerous loopholes for denying coverage.  

My dog was 5-6 years of age at adoption, his immune system was compromised and included ear, skin, and stomach issues.  The first vet diagnosed ""allergies"" as the root cause of his ear and skin. This was without medical history. They proscribed months of allergy treatments (Apoquel; Cadi shots) and dehydrated dog food yet with recurring infections.  
I stopped all medications and put him on fish oil pills, probiotics, and a minimal ingredient dog food. He had no ear, skin, or stomach issues for 10 months. Following a day at the beach, his ears/skin were irritated resulting in an ear infection.    
APSCA denied benefits stating ""allergies were noted 31 days prior to this policy coverage, although he went 10 months, allergies are OFTEN the root cause to an ear infection, are considered pre-existing"" and will never be covered. 
There is no medical proof supporting ALL ear and skin infections are from allergies yet I was asked to prove they're not. 

This was another loophole for ASPCA to deny benefits.

I finally threatened to cancel the policy if they didn't complete the claim within 3 days - guess what - they completed it in 2 days after my threat at the lower rate, which is a mistake.

62cc52380c20b4453c366634,False,False,"This company has lied to me from the start. I got insurance on both my dogs when they were puppies (11 & 12 years old now). They sold me on continuing care if they grew old and got a chronic condition. I paid over $100 to $150 a month for 10 years until my senior dog finally needed coverage. They have screwed me at every turn. They give me 3/4 (or less) of what I paid for our vet bill. Example: vet bill was $1,300 ASPCA will only pay off of $1,000 because they say in my area (which can‚Äôt be defined by the way) it ‚Äúshould‚Äù have cost that much. Then they take away the deductible and pay me the percentage based of the $1k minus the deductible. They rip you off at every turn and there is no way to fight it because, there is no defined ‚Äúarea‚Äùü§¨ BEWARE of this scam company! I have lots of documents to prove what I say. There has never been a bill that I didn‚Äôt feel like they screwed me over. The ONLY reason I have them is my dog is now a senior and cost is crazy to get them on another insurance. I have so many more examples of how they did me dirty with the continuing care I‚Äôve been paying on since the beginning to only find out it is only good for a year! Yep a year!

62b26590787382efe21394a1,False,False,"ASPCA Pet Insurance had been nothing but incredible for Picasso. I've left his annual deductible at 250, annual coverage at 7-10k each year since he was 3 and have reached it twice. Their claims process has been so easy. I'm able to upload my invoices by pictures to their online portal and the longest part is waiting for my vet to send records. Claims during COVID took longer because like everywhere else they had short staffing but they were transparent with estimates on claim completion. ASPCA has covered his TPLO, arthritis, IBD, prescription food, longterm medications, CT, and now chemotherapy. My only mistake was decreasing his coverage thinking I could make it a year at a lower rate but naturally that's when cancer hit. Their customer service has been incredible, employees have been realistic and pleasant, and reimbursement has been quick ( 1 week to 1month during covid). Their premiums aren't the cheapest I've seen but their coverage was the most comprehensive when I signed up. Rates do continue to go up, but so does everything in life. I've thankfully never used it for my cat but I have no doubt they would be just as amazing with her as they have been with Picasso.

I saw a lot of people put down their dogs because it was too expensive to simply diagnose their dogs. When we were put into an uncomfortable position to take our Saint to the hospital, we did it without hesitation because we knew that our insurance covered 90% of the bill with a $500.00 deductible. We did everything we could knowing that money (because of our insurance) was not an issue. I told myself that I would hate to be put in a position of putting my dog to sleep because of money.

I got my Cane Corso, Waylon, in early July of 2020, took him to his first vet appointment in late July, and purchased insurance within a couple weeks of that. So within the first month of having him he went to the vet and insurance policy had been purchased. When I took him to his initial veterinarian appointment to get established the vet gave me the run down on what to expect with this breed health wise as he was my first of this breed. In her briefing she mentioned to me something called entropion and warned it was common in this breed (along with stomach flipping and hip issues) so don't be surprised if he ends up with it even if it is mild. Over a year later in September 2021 he had surgery for entropion because he started showing signs of it, it was causing eye infections, and later was diagnosed with entropion. The surgery, medications, and recovery are a very costly process for a dog of this size. I filed the claim directly after his surgery and it was denied. I attempted to appeal and it was denied. The reason given was that his diagnosis was a preexisting condition according to the insurance due to vet records. False. Vet records mentioned that i was given a run down that entropion could be a possibility given how common it is with the breed, it was NOT a diagnosis of the condition. So they denied me, gave very short responses, and essentially was not allowed to appeal because they stated that the vet records were proof that it was preexisting. So, in a nut shell GO ELSEWHERE for your pet insurance and keep track of what your vet includes in their notes for your pet because it does matter what is mentioned to unethical insurance companies looking to get out of paying what they are supposed to.",1,"Unethical, Possible Scam, Terrible Customer Service",2,,2022-05-24T19:50:08.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/aspcapetinsurance.com?page=110

I really wasn't sure what the insurance covered but I did what I needed to do to find out what was wrong with my baby.  After several vet trips with tests and bloodwork and finally a biopsy my baby was diagnosed with Oral cancer.  She lasted about a week after the final diagnosis and we said our goodbyes at home when Paws into GRACE came to us.  The grief and the sadness we felt was overwhelming but I have to give this insurance company some major credit as I was able to get back more than half of what I had paid for Tsunami's end of life care and all the expenses to diagnose and treat.

626c1928166eb7ecbf385eb1,False,False,"I rarely write reviews but feel this is necessary since the cost of pet care has increased over the years and the accessibility to vet services has shrunk (primarily due to COVID-19 and the staffing/workplace issues it has caused). 

I researched pet insurances for my cat, 7 y.o./m/domestic, for a good year. He had no health problems (other than being two pounds overweight). But since he was turning 7, I figured it was a good time to get pet insurance and be more pro-active about preventative care. I was delighted when I found ASPCA because it's a nonprofit entity. Now, I know that ASPCA just licenses its name to the underwriting firm, but I would expect that such an institution would make sure that their name is used in good faith. Nothing could be further from the truth. 

ASPCA insurance is underwritten by Crump and Forster, a firm that also underwriters and administers pet insurance plans for several other pet insurance companies. 

I brought my cat to the vet 6 weeks after the ""waiting period"" on the insurance plan (two weeks from the effective date on the policy, which was March 11th). Anything that happens during the waiting period is considered ""pre-existing condition."" There were no issues with my cat. The only existing record occurred in May of 2021 that showed, aside from being slightly overweight, my cat was in perfect health. 

During the vet visit, it was decided my pet needed to see an  ophthalmologist to assist in diagnosing and treating what is thought to be conjunctivitis. This was an assessment made by the specialist who also conveyed that it may NOT be purely conjunctivitis, and a three week course of medicine would be required to assess. 

I left the vet's office with the medicine and follow up appointment. The total cost of the visit was $400 (not counting the medicine). 

Per the plan with the ASPCA, I have a $500 deductible. After submitting my claim with the ASPCA, and after affirmation from my vet's office that my cat was examined and treated for conjunctivitis, I saw that $0 of the $400 I spent during the visit would count towards my deductible. 

The ASPCA insurance reasoning was two codes w/out any explanation. 

Code 2 (Pre-existing condition) and Code 25 (not-covered). 

Per my policy, I met the conditions for having my cat's visit at least by somewhat contributory towards my annual deductible. When attempting to contact a representative, I was simply told what Code 2 and Code 25 mean. 

That is, no other explanation as to why was offered despite my dismay. Even someone at the veterinary office agreed that it was odd (to put it in kind terminology) that (a) conjunctivitis would be considered a pre-existing condition and (b) the insurance company would offer a code of ""not covered"" under the plan. 

After promptly cancelling my plan with ASPCA Pet Insurance, I re-read the policy twice more and came to the conclusion that the underwriters have written the policy in such a way that they can exclude anything at their discretion and give absolutely zero reasoning as to why. 

Upon cancelling, there was no final effort or communication to communicate to me why such denial codes were given, let alone an explanation for such. 

ASPCA Pet Insurance demonstrates why many pet owners think pet insurance is a scam. I followed the rules, did what was right for my cat, and was stonewalled. 

Obviously, I understand the ASPCA is different from the insurance company they contract with to offer pet insurance. But just be forewarned that you aren't actually dealing with the ASPCA. You're dealing with Crum and Forster (insurance plan admins) and the underwriting firm the company owns, United States Fire Insurance Company.

I reiterate that ASPCA simply licenses their branding and identity to the firm and has no interest, oversight, or interaction with ""their"" pet insurance.

I'm disappointed but not surprised at the outcomes associated with my brief time as an ""ASPCA Pet Insurance"" policy holder. Going forward, I will simply put some cash away each month and/or look into a product like Care Credit.",1,"Vague Policies, Poor Communication, Bad Outcomes",2,,2022-04-29T18:58:16.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/aspcapetinsurance.com?page=111

So fast forward to today and i spoke with James(a supervisor). Who so told me i don't qualify for any reimbursement despite meeting the $500 deductible as he claimed to have reviewed my claims and nothing I had was detailed until he started to read them whilst on the phone with me. He then goes to tell me that my pet's condition was pre-existing before starting with aspca. Which is not true, as at the time starting with aspca last year my dog had a hot spot which the vet said could be from shampoo, licking or lying on the area, James continued to tell me that all of my claims were allergy based. I explained to him as he agreed that my claims did mention everything I was telling him. My dog got diagnosed eventually with arthritis, James persisted on telling me this goes back to the ""hot spot allergy"". My vet did blood work to rule out everything elae and diagnosed it as being cancer. James said that he understands but that is related to allergies and aspca will not cover it. I said his hair loss he also had (which was symmetrical and all over his body coming out in clumps and veterinarian stated that it was endocrine related) and james said that too is allergy related. I asked if he was even listening to what i was saying? He literally never acknowledged me and said there is nothing they can do. But i can appeal but he said they will turn it down based on what i told him. This company is a scam, unethical, they make nothing intuitive or easy todo. And no one ever reaches back to the consumer. Someone has to be held responsible. I demand i get my money back as I clearly had no coverage or support, i should be compensated for doing their job of contacting each party.
I believe I am eligible to receive the money that I paid for this insurance per above.
If I do not get a reimbursement I will take the next actions to assure less people fall victim to this. As no one has been helpful, my dog is absolutely sick, we have a new born baby, and my research indicated that having pet insurance would make our lives less stressful. It made it more stressful, like I said previously, I always had to call you guys and my vet. James(the supervisor), told me my claim descriptions were not detailed enough until he reviewed them on the phone with me live. This leads me to the conclusion that ASPCA does not follow up with the Vet and Doctors to get the official diagnosis/diagnoses as it didn‚Äôt matter that I noted this on my claims. And wouldn‚Äôt you think at some point, customer service would have said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt reimburse for blah blah blah, so you don‚Äôt need to waste your time filing a claim, calling us and calling your vet‚Äù??",1,I have filed mutliple claims,2,,2022-04-11T01:58:23.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/aspcapetinsurance.com?page=115

I liked that you can tailor your plan to your pets specific needs. All the while making sure that you have enough coverage, and the deductible you‚Äôre comfortable having to come out of pocket for annually. The one downside, or inconvenience is that the claims aren‚Äôt handled by the veterinarians office. Each qualifying visit requires you to gather all the information for the form to be completed, and then send it to the claims center for review to get reimbursed.

61fdf922bc5a51af69b88b91,False,False,"Reading the reviews of this pet insurance lead me to believe it would be a fair and safe bet if my 11 year old dog were to develop an illness in her elder years. Unfortunately after paying into this plan for several months, they offered no financial support and took months to even respond to our claims.
Our dog became ill very shortly after the insurance went into effect, though there had been no signs and therefore no medical record of a pre-existing condition when we signed up for the insurance. If there had been, I wouldn‚Äôt have filed a claim for the illness. Although the condition- a terminal brain tumor- required an MRI for which was purportedly covered under the plan, upon filing a claim as we struggled with how to afford these suddenly overwhelming bills, we waited over 3 months for the claim to be denied. The ASPCA claimed flimsily that the condition had been pre-existing based on medical records describing lethargy and joint pain. These were attributed to old age by our vet, not neurological issues.
The ASPCA called and sent emails of condolence upon her passing, but this was empty comfort coming from a company that took my money without holding up their end of the bargain. I feel jaded by this experience. If you have a very healthy young dog and are willing to pay into a plan for years before being able to use it, it may be for you. But you may want to weigh the expense of paying into a costly pet insurance for years against the cost of the actual bills in the end, and also with the added risk that they will use any evidence in your pet‚Äôs medical record to deny your rightful claim.

I also applaud the ASPCA for not excluding pets when they become a certain age. ASPCA believes the care our pets need are the pet parents and the veterinarians decisions.

 Our cat Squishy became very ill recently and we have had many vet appointments. After our $500 deductible had been met, the insurance is paying 80% of her visits. This is helping out so much because I have had three pets that have been very ill and had no insurance. We had to pay thousands of dollars for care. She is very ill and I want to give her the best care.

The claim forms are very easy to send, email, fax, or you can use their app. The claims were taking about three to four weeks to be processed, but the claims are being paid much quicker now.

The wait times can be long on the phone, but I always leave my phone number. A representative always calls me back the same day and is very pleasant.

Thank you ASPCA for helping our family give the best care for our amimals.",4,ASPCA Pet Insurance,1,,2022-01-12T17:57:06.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/aspcapetinsurance.com?page=126

I understand that there are limits to what the insurance covers, but this company actually considers any conditions my pet has had in the past year a pre-existing condition, mind you, I have had this policy active for almost two years now. What a way to weasel out of actually helping pet owners cover the costs. Two months ago I submitted two claims where I paid more than $1,000 for my dog's vet visits (part of that was an allergy test to find out that my dog is chronically allergic to almost everything!) and I got a pitiful $34 reimbursed, on top of the $93 every month (22 months now) I am paying into the insurance. I feel like I would have actually saved money by not having this so-called ""Insurance"" after all. Even worse is that this provider is not even run by the ASPCA themselves (an actually good organization), but by Crum and Forster Insurance Group which only purchased the rights to use the name of ASPCA. Long wait times for claims, pitiful reimbursements, considering anything from last year's coverage period now a pre-existing condition, and on top of that, I can't even talk to somebody over the phone due to ""higher call volumes"" or whatever excuse they have. I would expect that with all the money I (and other pet owners) am paying that they could at least hire more staff to handle the call volumes, but apparently they don't hire anybody at all. What is the point of having insurance if it won't actually help you when you need it? I still am expected to pay the full price upfront for any and all medical needs for my pet, including accidental injuries or illnesses. What option is there for somebody who cannot afford the upfront costs for an unexpected emergency with their pet? Just let them suffer or die?

61042266f9f487044c4d028e,False,False,"We‚Äôve had a policy on our cat, Piggy Grace, since October 2018. Every year, our monthly premium has increased by a few dollars, with no explanation for the increase. 

This year, when her policy renews in October, our monthly premium will increase by $10!  This moves us from $33 a month to $43 dollars a month. Again, no explanation given for the increase. 

Piggy Grace was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease in December 2019. Therefore, we are unable to look for more affordable coverage because all other insurance companies classify the CKD as a pre-existing condition and won‚Äôt cover her medical treatments. 

This leaves us with two options:  reduce Piggy‚Äôs annual limit and/or reduce her reimbursement percentage, or cancel our policy. Neither option is in her best interest.  

Raising monthly premiums this drastically puts many pet guardians of a sick animal in a difficult position and forces them to make hard decisions.  A diagnosis of CKD is heartbreaking on many levels.  The only consolation we had was knowing that we could provide the absolute best care for Piggy because of her insurance.

09/15/2021 update in response to the reply from ASPCA Pet Health Insurance on this review:  

I emailed your customer service to discuss this issue (no one ever replied to the email or called me).  I called customer service today:  first, let me say that the representative was very kind and as helpful as she could be in this situation.  However, she gave me the same answer that you gave on this review.  She could only offer the advice of reducing our annual coverage or increasing our deductible to keep our monthly premium at a lower rate.  

Once again, no one has been able to explain to me why our monthly premium is increasing by $10!  So frustrating.",1,Monthly Premiums Increase Every Year,0,,2021-07-30T16:01:42.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/aspcapetinsurance.com?page=149

I submit claims every time she needs care, and they almost never count towards my deductible or reimbursement. They always find a reason to decline coverage. It makes me think they don't care about animals afterall. The routine care supplemental policy is not worth it. Their annual limits are nowhere near what the care actually costs, so you get a fraction back. They take weeks to process you claims, and if their verdict is incorrect, expect to wait another few weeks to even hear back.

ASPCA has made good on all of it. His premium has paid for itself. When I called customer service to ask questions about continuing care when his new policy cycle begins, the call center rep was very kind, patient, honest and informative. Biggest pro is that, unlike other places, conditions can‚Äôt be considered pre-existing from a previous policy cycle. TLDR: one cat‚Äôs payouts have paid for the premium and then some- my other cat is the pinnacle of health and the payouts haven‚Äôt added up, but if he ever has an accident or something like that, I‚Äôll know we‚Äôre covered. The preventative care option isn‚Äôt the best- I‚Äôm dropping it next year. Overall, very pleased. The only sucky thing is the time it takes to process claims.

Yes, the claims are taking longer lately, but it's understandable since pet ownership is on the rise, work force is reduced and claim numbers have been increased. I have had them for about 6 years, and they always processed claims effectively, and barely ever needed additional information from the vet. I always try to make sure that I request detailed bill before I submit the claim, so I minimize the chances of them needing something from the vet. Recently my baby girl (9yr old boxer) has been diagnosed with lymphoma and she has been going to the oncology specialist and has received couple chemo treatments. Bills are huge. Yes, they did take longer than usual (I rec'd an email from them telling me that they are having high volume of claims and they were apologizing for the delay) but they processed them and paid almost full 90% as promised. The only reason I can afford this expensive chemo therapy is due to me counting on them to reimburse me so I can pay the bill. So overall, I wish I had this kind of insurance myself.

5ecd78d925e5d209b8f54926,False,False,"When Olly had a giant GI issue in October of 2019, I started looking into Accident and Illness pup insurance. He already had a wellness package with his veterinarian, but like many of you have already found out - these generally only include wellness visits, dentals, and vaccines.

This wasn't going to cut it. I spent weeks researching pet insurance. Best reviewed companies, emails to representatives, trial basses, pre-existing conditions checks. The top ranked companies all failed my most basic expectations. 

Dental tartar - a pre-existing condition. A hot spot from a cone that rubbed his neck raw, a pre-existing condition. Things that not even a human insurance would consider ""pre-existing"" - all pre-existing. 

This appalled me. I would think a pet insurance company would truly care for the animals they care for. Not one of them did.

I started looking at customer reviews for these companies. They were horrendous, the people agreed.

I finally stumbled across the ASPCA's, underwritten by a Fire Insurance company. I was amazed. This companies customer reviews blew all others out of the water. Their stipulations were fair and compassionate at the same time. Pre-existing conditions were not a ghost to forever haunt your medical history. 

I signed up and I moved on with my life and forgot about it. Until Olly developed GDV during the COVID 19 shutdown. Three veterinary visits in one day. Followed by a trip to the Animal Emergency Clinic that night and emergency surgery. 

I had more vet visits in 1 month than I ever had in a year (and let's face it, I love him, but my dog is a lemon) - and I remembered the insurance I purchased. 

I downloaded the app, took a few pictures of paperwork and submitted his first claim. Simple as that. The wait time for processing wasn't horrible. I received my reimbursement. It had truly been a blessing. Where I would have had no other choices, I was able to save Olly when I otherwise wouldn't have been able to afford it.

If I could ask for one thing, it would be the ability for bills to be handled like humans at a doctors office. Unfortunately, everything is paid by you in advance to the hospitals and clinic. This is a requirement of the hospitals and clinics themselves.

5e84af8e3c93ae031457ea31,False,False,"As a veterinary professional, I know how valuable pet insurance is and opt to cover both of my cats for peace of mind should they ever need emergency surgery or oncology treatment. Coverage is great as most things are included, but one of my cat's premiums went up 37% this year. When I called to inquire to the steep increase, I was told that it was a combination of an across the board increase for all cats and and increase for her age, as she just turned 5yr. Of course, I can't sustain that kind of increase every year so I asked what I could expect going forward. I was given the yearly percentage increase I can expect every year for the rest of her life (except age 6) - which is anywhere from 4.7-20% each year. Only two increases between now and age 16 would be less than 10%, most are 10-17%. I understand costs increase with age but these increases are much to steep and I can't realistically afford them long term. I'd try to switch insurance companies but she now has one pre-existing condition that won't be covered by anybody else now - so I feel trapped with ASPCA if I want her to have coverage. I don't know how I'm going to find the money for these annual increases, even just in the next 5 years - but it's either that or she gets no coverage.

The area I do not agree with is their ""opinion"" of pre-existing conditions. A dog that itches doesnt mean it is related to allergies. Could be mites, atopic dermatitis, a crawling insect, and so much more! When I adopted my dog he has some itchy skin. The vet did skin scrape and nothing abnormal was seen however we treated as if it was demodex and after a little while the itching resolved. Over a year later my dog developed itching so since I am in the veterinary field I chose to take him to a dermatologist. ASPCA said the ""itching"" was pre-existing. He was itching for a completely different reason. I appealed and the still determined it was pre-existing. Not much I can do but keep them because my dog will need another hip surgery soon and I cant go to another company because that really is pre-existing.
So all in all I should have gone with another company especially since I get a discount through my job for nationwide.

Be aware that if your pet gets sick, the insurance company can easily deny coverage based on lab work performed previously. There are many customer with the same complaint or even worse, just read the reviews with 1 or 2 stars.

They will simply deny any coverage if your pet had elevated numbers in previous lab work and label it as preexisting condition. 

All this time I thought this company would be a peace of mind to us when you need them the most. But I was wrong and they just took all the money I‚Äôve paid for about 3 years.

I never used their benefits because my cat has been healthy for about 14 years. Now my cat has been unwell, she lacks of appetite and has weigh loss.

I took her to the vet, they did a completely lab work and the doctor said that her kidneys are failing. The doctor suggested three days of IV fluids in the hospital to help her with the toxins in the blood.

I called ASPCA to have an authorization to proceed with the IV therapy, and they simply said that they won‚Äôt cover it because this is related to a lab work she had 2 years ago.
 
Now, not even the future care is not going to be cover but the also the tests and visit performed yesterday.

My cat was never diagnosed with any disease before now, but the insurance support their denial based on the lab work she had two years ago.

They just let me paid the premiums all this time but never notified me or letting me know that due to those test results my cat was never going to be cover.

Now after paying more than $600 in premiums for the ‚ÄúIllnesses and Accident‚Äù coverage and another $500 for yesterday‚Äôs visit, they keep telling me that the latest test and vet visit won‚Äôt be covered because it is related to the tests two years ago.

Now if my cat passes away, the euthanasia and the cremation won‚Äôt be covers because according to the insurance the visit and lab work is related to the tests performed 2 years ago and those charges won‚Äôt satisfy the deductible.

You assume...that's what you pay the monthly premium for. Yet while sitting next to another pet parent who was panicked because her insurance did not cover her dogs emergency surgery i became panicked and phoned a rep. First thing, the rep could read the anxiety and crackling in my voice and reassured me and calmed me down. She asked what was going on and explained SHE could not guarantee benefits over the phone but would work with the surgical staff to immediately get an estimate to their dept that would approve the procedure or not. Within an hour the procedure was approved.  The kindness and concern for my well being and my pets was greater than my friends or our family other than our immediate  family. It should be noted that this is the second time in three months we had to call on our insurance, met with the same care and respect.  Regarding ease of submission,  you literally load an app and take a picture of your bill and submit it. That easy.

5d24a7a042fa560af433d63b,False,False,"I have a 6.5 year old french bulldog who was insured by Nationwide through my job's old benefit offering. When they switched to new medical plan, they were no longer a partner with Nationwide so I was on a new hunt for pet insurance for my pup.

I did extensive research and decided to go with ASPCA. My dog has been healthy most of her life, with only minor issues such as allergies...however, as soon as I switched over to this insurance, we started having a few medical issues with her which at first seemed like scary health scares. Let's just say in my first 3 months of ASPCA, we had over $1,500 of vet bills from emergency visits. ASPCA was very quick to review and approve all claims. I was honestly, shocked. I was sure they would give us issues since we've only been on the plan for a few months, but they didn't...at all. I uploaded all of our bills, posted all the explanations and all of my claims were processed between 1-2 weeks.

I have heard horror stories about insurance companies denying coverage for a multitude of crazy reasons and as nervous as I was about ASCPA, I couldn't be happier about my choice. I am hoping that they will continue providing the level of support as they have these last few months, for the rest of my dog's life. 

I should also add that for a 6.5 year old french bulldog, her plan is comparable in price (note- it's not cheap, but neither is any other company for a middle aged pure bred dog( to some of the more expensive insurance companies, but she gets much more coverage through ASPCA for what I pay than with any of the other competitors.

ASPCA came highly recommended so I purchased insurance with them 1 week before receiving our new puppy thinking I was ahead of the game.  She ended up having a UTI and Guardia which seem to be common in puppies. After sending in over $800 in claims, we find out that in small print there is in fact a 2 week waiting period before they pay any claims. On top of that, if anything was diagnosed within that 2 week waiting period, they will not cover even after your waiting period is over!  This is absolutely ridiculous!  You have to wait 6 months after puppy is cleared of any pre existing condition before they will even consider paying. I find this absolutely unnacceptable!

Our puppy had to go to the emergency room and was hospitalized for several days. It was stressful and would have been even worse if we had to figure out how to pay for his treatment out of pocket. We were glad that we didn't have to make any decisions based on financial constraints and could just give him all the extra care he needed.

Submitting claims is easy online, and we received the reimbursement within a couple weeks. We decided not to get preventative care, but in hindsight we wish we had, as our little guy has been high maintenance. When we come up for renewal, I will probably add the preventative care.

5cbdbeb8a8436908c40d2ffd,False,False,"Absolutely love this insurance carrier!   I have nothing but wonderful things to say about APSCA. My dog has been suffering from chronic diarrhea (with blood) About a month or so after I signed up for the plan and I've been in/out of the vet seeking answers/treatment for her. She seems to be doing better as long as she's on the metronidazole (antibiotics) 3x a day along with a high end probiotic and prescription food. As soon as I try to lower the antibiotic dose, she ends up with the diarrhea again,  so she she's basically been on this antibiotic for 3 months while having x-rays, ultrasound and upper/lower GI scope in hopes to find the underlying cause of the chronic diarrhea.  If only you could imagine the stress that I've been dealing with these last few months (not knowing why or what is causing this problem, but also knowing my baby is in some sort of discomfort). At the same time, I am truly thankful for the amount of coverage (saved me a lot of money) that the ASPCA has helped me & my fur-baby. In addition to actual coverage,  I must say that their customer service is amazing too!  Shelly (customer service rep) Called to check in with me to see how my dog was doing due to the claims that I had been submitting and she was very genuine and showed a great deal of sympathy for what my dog was going through.  I even received a card wishing my dog well! 
My only complaint would be, having issues setting up direct deposit via the App. Since I had Shelly on the line and addressed the direct deposit issue, she offered to manually enter  my account information on her end for me ( and it worked because my next claim was direct deposited into my account). Since Shelly activated the direct deposit for me, I have been getting the direct deposit within  24-48 hours after my claim(s) are completed. 
From my point of view, I believe whatever negative feedback that you see on here about coverage is due to pre-existing  conditions and that some folks are just upset that ASPCA won't cover it. It clearly states if your animal has been seen in the past for this problem...it is considered ""pre-existing!""
When I first started submitting my claims, I noticed it took several weeks along with another 2 weeks before i would get a reimbursement check. Although, I noticed the last few claims they are being processed a lot quicker (4-5 days & 24-48 hrs after for the direct deposit). I'm assuming that since they can see the previous claims and the history with my dogs chronic diarrhea that maybe it makes the process easier for them?! 
As far as moving forward with ASPCA... As long as my annual premium doesn't go up tremendously,  I plan on remaining a customer of ASPCA forever!  Again, I am HIGHLY impressed with their service and couldn't be more happier with my pick of insurance (I'm sure you won't be either!). 
I will continue to recommend ASPCA insurance to anyone that has a pet(s)!",5,Absolutely love this insurance carrier!,0,,2019-04-22T13:16:40.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/aspcapetinsurance.com?page=212
5cb89b4fa8436906a0d7dd0a,False,False,"I have been using this insurance for both of my dogs since 2012. When they say they will cover 90% of your pet's accidents, injuries and illnesses, that is not exactly true. Since I began using this insurance in 2012, the plans have changed and now they offer better plans than what I currently have. For instance, they will cover 90% of the ""average cost"" of treatment for my pets in my area and not the ""actual cost"" of treatment. The average cost for my area is never anywhere close to being 90% of what I pay at the vet. When I called to inquire about upgrading to the newer plans that base your reimbursement off of the actual cost instead of the average cost, they basically said if my dogs have any issues going forward, in relation to what they have covered with this older plan, they will no longer cover it because it will then be considered ""pre-existing"" even though I was insured by them at the time of the initial diagnoses. However, if I keep the current plan, they will still cover any issues that arise, based solely off of the ""average cost.""  Considering one of my dogs has torn both ACL's and both Meniscus ligaments while being insured under the older plan, I am too scared to upgrade and then she have a complication in regards to those 4 major knee surgeries down the road. When speaking with Sarah, who works in the ""Questions About Claims"" department over the phone about how this is not a loyal program to clients who have been with them for several years, her response was ""Well it is better that we cover something rather than nothing at all."" The way I see it is that I am paying $67/month, my dogs most recent vet bill was $862 and they only reimbursed me $462. If I put $67/month in an account for my dogs each month instead of sending it to insurance then I would come out much cheaper than taking the chance of insurance not covering the bills. My biggest complaint is that they do not have any type of loyalty to customers such as myself, who has been with them for 7 years now and for me customer service is everything. Without great customer service and the willingness to take care of your long term clients, how can you expect to keep those clients?",1,Not Loyal to Long-Term Members,0,,2019-04-18T15:44:15.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/aspcapetinsurance.com?page=212

5b8f13e88c83fd0b58d4262a,False,False,"My experience with this pet insurance company has been a complete nightmare.  I signed my dachshund up with ASPCA in August 1st of 2016.  My dog Winston was 9 years old at the time and had no preexisting conditions.  In the past two years the plan has gone up in price substantially (I started out paying $36.00 a month and I now pay $56.00 a month).  Now get this.  It is June of this year when my dog got diagnosed with Lymphoma (a quick growing cancer that has a prognosis of two months).  For the first time in Winston's life he has an illness that is severe and needs significant treatment.  At this point I am overjoyed that I have put so much money into a pet insurance company that has a limit of $3,000 dollars in order to help prolong Winston‚Äôs life (being that I am a grad school student graduate I have significant student loan debt and this monthly $56.00 of allotted money that I was putting towards my pet insurance was precious and significant).  Because of ASPCA‚Äôs policy that refuses to provide reimbursement for continued treatment after the renewal date (as in‚Äîbecause I started my pet insurance on August 1st, they refuse to reimburse me should Winstons‚Äô treatment‚Äôs continue beyond this date, although the yearly limit they provide that they will reimburse towards is $3,000)  This appears to violate the agreement that I and many others might assume to exist in that they will provide reimbursement for bills accrued due to illness, accidents, etc. Their abrupt cancelations for canceling reimbursement for my dogs treatment appeared callous and cold as well as only covered two chemotherapy treatments out of the minimum of five that were recommended.  My vet (Dr. Lauren Silverman, DVM) at Healthy Pet‚Äôs Veterinary Hospital in the West Portal District of San Francisco (where Winston was diagnosed with lymphoma), as well as my current Oncologist (Dr. Bryan Marker DVM, DACVIM) have expressed their dismay and disrespect for the insurance companies apparent disregard for their abrupt cessation of reimbursement support for vet bills right before a renewal date.  Had Winston been diagnosed with cancer in September, he would have had 11 months of reimbursable treatments that could have prolonged his life (as Winston was responding favorably to the chemotherapy).  I am extremely disappointed that the massive fine print in the ASPCA pet insurance allows them to feel compelled to not reimburse me for any treatment taking place after August 3rd when my pet insurance is renewed.  The vets that have grown to love Winston have decided to stop recommending ASPCA pet insurance to their patients due to the numerous loop holes which allow them to escape responsibility for reimbursing for vet bills. That said, some companies use benefit schedules or ‚Äúusual and customary‚Äù charges to determine how much they‚Äôll reimburse. The issue with these reimbursements is that the company sets a limit for how much they‚Äôll pay based on your pet‚Äôs diagnosis. That means if your vet happens to charge more than what they have designated for that condition, you‚Äôll end up footing the difference like I have done all too often with this pet insurance.   I have now only been reimbursed $1,038 dollars an entire month after submitting my claim for $1,300.  Not only has this pet insurance nickeled and dimed me as much as possible, but they have made it so I am now paying even MORE based on the interest this amount has accrued on my credit card.  I too must speak out against this grave injustice that I feel I have experienced at the detriment of my pet‚Äôs lifespan.  I am crying writing this review, knowing my baby has only about a month left and has already started to decline dramatically due to his cancer tumors returning.  I only hope that this review can assist someone who loves their pet the way that I do in making a better pet insurance decision.",1,Underwritings and Fine Print- How ASPCA scams their customers,0,,2018-09-04T23:23:20.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/aspcapetinsurance.com?page=223

ASPCA covered 90% of all fees less the $250 deductible! Not only that but I filed the claim on a Monday and received the money in my account that Friday! It was quick, easy and the service I signed up to a ""T""! I have recommended them to multiple people I know with fur babies and will continue to do so!

After reading a ton of reviews (after I had already carried insurance with ASPCA for over a year) I was really nervous I would not get to utilize the insurance. Many reviews make the process sound difficult or like they actually wouldn't cover much/will fight you regardless as to the plan. 

I honestly think people either have the wrong plan for what they are attempting to cover, did not read the fine print regarding covering certain conditions in certain time frames (my dog had to go 6 months without incident from the first surgery to be covered for the second) or simply did not file their claim with all the necessary documents (ie: a year of medical records, itemized bills, etc...) in a timely enough manner. This stuff is all lain out on the website so I'm not sure how someone could miss it but read it carefully!!!

Jumping off the couch? Running and tripping on a ditch? Chasing a cat? Who knows?  So we took him to the vet, they x-rayed him and stated that an injury caused his limping noting something about a possible small fracture and deemed it as arthritis due to an injury. They refused to cover it because they said they don't know if the injury occurred before we got insurance or not. Well, he's three. There are a lot of things that could have happened prior to adopting him but one thing is certain-he wasn't limping and then he was. My insurance covered accidents and injuries yet they refused to cover it at all. Additionally, the plan option coverage costs were expensive. Over $40 a MONTH for full coverage.

A tumor on one of her toes that was cancerous, but my vet was able to cure her by amuptating the toe.  The other being dental disease, which my vet had to extract several teeth.  Fortunately my boxer was able to heal and fully recover from all of her health issues.  My pet insurance gave no issues for the most part and took care of 80% of the majority of the costs. ASPCA made follow up phone calls to see how my dog was doing after the surgeries too, which I thought was very thoughtful.  The only negative is that my pet insurance was about $30 per month when I first got the insurance and it is now $60 per month.  Keep in mind the breed of the dog and the level of the plan.  I do not have the highest level.  Although I'm not to happy about the monthly charge increasing so much, it does help when a serious injury or health concern arises.

Two of my cats lived to the ages of 17 and 18 respectively, and Vet care at that age can get expensive and having insurance to mitigate the cost of their end of life care is a lifesaver.  Of course, the insurance also paid for illnesses and dental extractions earlier in my cats' lives which was also helpful.  I recently added another cat (a 2-year-old) to my ASPCA insurance because I want her to be covered from the start and I believe that it is only fair to the insurance company to insure the cats when they are young in order to pay off later when they are older and their health eventually deteriorates.

Unfortunately, we had to change vets three times before finding one that was a good fit for Waldo. Since his medical history is sparse, I wasn't aware that he has adverse reactions to many drugs, as well as a very sensitive stomach.

ASPCA Pet Health Insurance has been great, covered all Waldo's care according to the plan I purchased and called to follow up each claim to see how he was doing and if everything was okay. Payment was made quickly and no questions, even though the changing of vets and treatment for reaction to medications must have seemed confusing.

578aad080000ff0009714248,False,False,"Four years ago I rescued a hulking big cat that is about 6 years old now, and appropriately named Sampson. All was fine the first 2 years, then bad things started to happen.  He had a blocked urethra twice, the first one nearly killing him, Then there was a bacterial infection in his stomach and, perhaps, because of the needed meds, we found his liver numbers were over the moon.  Prescription drugs did not stop the soaring numbers and as a last resort we put him on Milk Thistle and his numbers were almost normal in 2 weeks. Now we are working on finding out what is causing his high white blood count.  Thousands have been spent on x-rays, medications, scans and exams and without ASPCA, this boy would not be here now because I'm on SS and could never afford all that he needed and would have had to put him down.  I love this company. The people I've talked to have been wonderful and truly concerned.  They even call to see how he is doing. AND, the reimbursement check(s) arrive in a timely manner. Even my Vet is amazed as he was the one who endorsed you, and is pretty happy about that. (He was getting too many complaints from clients about the prior company he had endorsed and had heard about you from other patients.)  So keep up the good work so that we can all sleep at night!!   (We all know that nothing bad happens at 11:000 a.m on a Tuesday.)

So, God Bless you all for being so good to all of your clients, both pets and parents, and keeping your prices at a rate that even someone on SS can afford.

Sure there are years when I pay more in premiums then I get back, but the same goes with my own health insurance. Having pet insurance means piece of mind in knowing that when my dog tore his ACL and was in pain and needed surgery and PT, that I was going to be getting back 80% (of the usual and customary charges) and that helped immensely in deciding to do the surgery. As the years have gone on, and knowing that I will not be putting my aging dog through surgery anymore, I was able to customize his insurance level and just have a basic plan that covers accidents and illness. I will not lie... over the years the premiums have increased alot, but for me it has been money well spent.

There were only a small handful of charges on the surgeon itemized list that were not paid at 90%.

I like the fact you can log in to your account, see when received, and where they are with the process.   To expedite the payment I had the vet copy all of Ovi's records and sent with first billing.   Important to know there are some exceptions...to coverage with timelines.  ACL is a bilateral issue and there is a waiting period of a year if the pet had one before.  These are the most pleasant people to work with at ASPCA.

As soon as we did, we purchased ASPCA health coverage for all of our cats - the two new babies as well as Simon and Alvin's younger brother Theodore.  We have given ourselves peace of mind.  We know that we can give our cats proper health care.  Our coverage not only takes care of them when they are ill, but they are also covered for ""well cat"" checkups.

He eventually passed at the Lab-ripe age of 18 from histiosarcoma.  After 13 years dealing with that agency, coverage was denied based on fine print written in several 5-point size disclaimers allowing the company to interpret anything they wanted.  Needless to say, I will never, ever, deal with these folks again.  

Enter ASPCA Health Insurance.  I initially went in with trepidation but my vets were enthusiastic about them.  I've been with them now for seven years and it has been superb.  My dog was a rescue who had been abused and neglected so he needed extra care, initial medical treatment, etc.  Insurance coverage was excellent.  Fast forward six years and my furry son had a serious accident falling during an ice storm that made roads, driveways and our yard into an ice skating rink.  Two days of emergency care, several orthopedic specialists, pain and inflammation drug cocktails, and now therapy.

I can't extol the positives of ASPCA insurance enough.  They have been superb in every respect.  I even got a call from one of their agents as to how my dog was doing.

56f0a35e0000ff0009483929,False,False,"Most of us can recall 1 or more experiences with insurance & quite often it conjures up a negative stigma. I was less than eager about this to say the least, but the thought of even one unexpected enormous bill held an even higher priority. So I thought ""What can it hurt to look at premiums/deductibles etc"". I was very PLEASANTLY surprised!! 

To solidify my decision, I asked the opinions of a few very highly sought Animal Allergists  & Veterinarians. They ALL recommended ASPCA Pet Health Insurance above the others. Siting their short claim turn around, overall genuine care & concern, competency & quite a low % of client complaints.

Purchasing pet insurance was a 1st for me. In fact, this was my first dog too. Inside the first 30 days my puppy needed emergency surgery after ingesting something still unknown to date. The object was coiling around her colon and causing her high levels of pain etc. Her regular Vet Dr. & the staff at our Veterinary Hospital were superb...as usual.

Well that's where the ""happy happy"" feeling usually ends. NOT in this case! The ASPCA Pet Health policy did EXACTLY what they promised AND MORE. Once I sent in my claim:  (1) an ASPCA rep called to acknowledge they had my paperwork & processing had begun; (2) several other reps followed up to simply to ask how Luna was feeling, acting & healing; and (3) my reimbursement check, minus the obvious deductible, arrived in less then 14 business days.

Our furry babies are family, we adore them & they love us unconditionally. That said, it's an easy decision....when they need help, we are their sole means of help & we must be able to step up on their behalf. With ASPCA Pet Health Insurance on our side it's a no brainier. I truly hope this helps you make your final decision.
