Despite my repeated attempts to provide all necessary records, it took over a month for any progress to be made. Neither myself nor my clinic spared any effort in supplying the required documentation, only to be met with further delays. When I finally requested to speak to a supervisor, I was blindsided by the revelation that my claim wouldn't proceed due to a previously undisclosed requirement for “two years worth of records.” This information should have been made clear from the start, sparing me the wasted time and money on a policy. Frustrated, I promptly requested to cancel my policy as it was proven futile. Yet, to add insult to injury, I received notification today, over a month later, that my claim was miraculously processed. This entire ordeal has left me feeling utterly disrespected and undervalued as a customer. I am deeply convinced that my claims were only processed because I cancelled my policy. Now, faced with the devastating news of my pet's cancer diagnosis, I find myself in an even more precarious situation. Any other insurance provider would likely classify this as a pre-existing condition, leaving me without the financial support I need during this emotionally and financially taxing time. This leaves me with no choice but to either reinstate my policy with SPOT or face the prospect of having no insurance coverage at all, compounding the stress and burden I'm already under.

Fast forward to now, where we have recently found out he has some sort of allergy.

They do not have a formal appeals department either - you write them a letter and email it to them.

65f47402970c9c919a684f10,False,False,"We're into our 4th year as Spot clients for our two Golden Retrievers.  We picked Spot for it coverage because they covered (at least at the time) issues specific to the Golden Retriever breed, hip/elbow dysplasia and cancer, without any wait period. While not the least expensive, you get what you pay for.  Once you understand that basic pet insurance will not cover the routine visits, but is meant for illness/accident coverage, you'll save yourself a lot of grief.  Spot has been great in paying what I felt was covered, and the process for filing a claim over the last few years has improved immensely.  It is done on-line, a few clicks, down load the invoice and submit.  You can track the status of your claim by logging-in to your account.
Been very happy with Spot, premiums went up over the lock down years, but most recent was considerable less than prior year, even with our dogs now 3 and 7 y/o, a very pleasant surprise!  Recommend Spot

Spot continued to deny all claims because they wanted several years of past medical history and documentation -- for a cat from the pound!  Not too many rescue pets come with medical history! If they don't cover shelter adoptees then they shouldn't be taking my premium payments. I was ready to cancel my policy and mentioned to them that I was going to submit a complaint to my state Insurance Commissioner.  Suddenly, they started paying my claims!  Since then, they have processed claims within a week and have paid for everything except for prescription food. I decided not to challenge them about the food because I was just so relieved to stop fighting with them. Not recommended for rescue pets because of the nonsense about requiring medical history. I now have another rescue cat and will use a different provider for her pet insurance.",2,Not Recommended for Shelter Adoptions,0,2023-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,2024-01-28T20:04:45.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/spotpetins.com?page=39

65ac491e6e2b0d113a5b5858,False,False,"I was initially excited about Spot Pet Insurance, hoping it would be the perfect solution for my pet’s healthcare needs. The idea of having a wellness policy that covers important vaccinations like Rabies and Lyme’s disease seemed ideal. However, my experience has been a mix of satisfaction and disappointment.

The main issue lies in the representation of the wellness policy’s coverage. Before purchasing, the policy details seemed to promise comprehensive coverage for various vaccines, including Rabies and Lyme’s disease. This was a major selling point for me. However, post-purchase, the reality was different. The policy specifies a maximum of $25 coverage, but only for one vaccine, not for each as I had assumed based on the pre-purchase information. This was misleading, especially since the website mentioned no such maximums initially, leading one to believe that each shot in a vaccine series would be reimbursed.

While I appreciate the coverage Spot does provide, the discrepancy between the pre-purchase promises and the actual policy terms is concerning. It feels like a significant oversight or, worse, an intentional misrepresentation. For a consumer who is not meticulously analyzing the fine print, this can be quite deceiving.

In conclusion, while I want to love Spot for its pet insurance offerings, the gap between expectation and reality in terms of policy coverage has dampened my enthusiasm. I believe clearer communication and transparency in policy details would greatly improve customer experience and satisfaction.",3,Mixed Feelings About Spot Pet Insurance - A Three-Star Review,0,2024-01-20T00:00:00.000Z,2024-01-21T00:28:47.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/spotpetins.com?page=42

659815648cadf51aa61fc470,False,False,"I was initially so excited about Spot after researching a bunch of pet insurance companies! I'd had pets nearly all my life but never had ventured into pet insurance before. I have an older GSD and a young, wild GSD pup so it felt like a good time. 
Nope. 
Going to be a one year purchase and then I'm out. 
The app and user experience is slick and easy, So that's not the issue. And the price wasn't outrageous for what I thought was decent coverage. Those are the two stars. 
All I can say is read every line of the small print and maybe show it to a lawyer. I DID read it carefully, and I'm alert and suspicious. But when my dog tore his CCL and required surgery, it was denied and I was shocked. Here's why: midway through the 5 or so pages of small print, there was a definition of animal anatomy (I'm paraphrasing from memory): bilateral body parts are considered as a single unit (meaning front legs are one unit, 2 kidneys (I suppose)... 2 pages later at the end, it said that preexisting conditions weren't covered. Of course! I thought to myself. So when my dog tore his CCL they saw from vet records that he'd torn his opposite knee 3 years before... cue the bilateral definition from mid-document. His rear legs were one so the knee surgery he'd had years before were considered prior conditions spread over to the previously healthy leg.  
Wow. I would not have put those two widely separated sections together. We were left high and dry with a useless accident and illness policy that didn't actually cover an accident.
The other thing is check what your vet charges for routine car against the reimbursement amounts Spot provides. I didn't do this, so my bad. 
I had the wellness policy I for my puppy. The reimbursements are adequate for maybe covering the cost of a low income spay neuter clinic sponsored by the humane society, but NO vet in private practice charges the modest fees that are anywhere close to the small amounts they charge for procedures and check-ups. 
I live in a rural area. My vet is not outrageous, but I am still left paying hundreds of dollars for spaying and dozens of dollars for vaccines and wellness checkups even after Spot kicks in its small reimbursements.

I had no problems during the first year and none of her claims were turned down. I adopted a second dog in the spring of 2023 and added her to my plan. Because I was adding a second dog and because she was only 2, her rate was much cheaper! I was able to increase her plan and still have the rate be below $60 per month! I renewed my plan a couple months ago and increased my senior dogs plan a bit, and still between the two of them it's less than $200 per month with great coverage and a high reimbursement percentage.

My cat was diagnosed with HCM and never in his short life showed ANY symptoms of that condition. Unfortunately that is why it’s known as the “silent killer”. Also, no emails explaining in depth why it was denied. Not a pre-existing condition and was never seen for anything related to this.

Unfortunately I chose to go with Spot as they had sponsored ads and a low premium. I also made the mistake of thinking I probably would not need it. 

I signed up and after the waiting period I ended up having to take out kitten to the emergency room as her body had an allergic reaction and become entirely inflamed and covered in open wounds. 

I was referred to a specialist in which we are still in the process of diagnosing the exact concern. 

Spot immediately declined all claims stating this is pre existing as prior to the full body reaction her spay incision had become infected and they are saying because of that they will not cover her claims for any of her issues.

SPOT insurance is a fraudulent company that refuses to cover vet bills.  My dog was seen for an ear infections related to wet ears.  SPOT denied the claim because my dog had previously been seen at an emergency vet when she rolled in grass and had foxtails embedded in her ears.  SPOT stated that my pet had a pre-existing condition of ear infections which is untrue because foxtail removal from ears is NOT related to allergies or infections.  Spot then claims that my dog was diagnosed with allergies and allergies are a non-curable condition therefore SPOT will not cover any visit or prescription related to allergies.  SPOT then continues to state that my dog's ear infection is related to allergies.  My dog was NEVER diagnosed with allergies or seen by a vet for allergies until the visit when I submitted a claim.  For each claim and each appeal I have filed I have been given a different excuse as to why my claim was denied.  I was a customer for a few months which is why I believe my claim was denied because SPOT would not have received enough money in premiums to cover the cost of the claim reimbursement.  If the excuses for denial were consistent I would be more likely to believe that SPOT was not a fraudulent company, however they know what to say and how to manipulate medical records to deny payment for a claim.",1,SPOT insurance is a fraudulent company…,0,2023-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,2023-09-07T21:54:29.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/spotpetins.com?page=139

64d9f2bae6a44d2aba9c5d52,False,False,"UPDATE: After leaving this review I received a call telling me how to appeal a claim which I will be doing. On another note my cat recently got Urinary crystals and had to goto a few emergency vet visits. He had this problem a few years ago and was cured of it and in remission for over a year now. I’m so relieved and grateful that spot stayed true to their policy and did not consider this a pre-existing condition. At this moment I feel the pros outweigh the cons and say I think they are worth giving a chance. 

—————————————————

I think this insurance is useless if you have an older pet. They should be more clear and upfront about that before people spend the money they need to pay their vet bills on this insurance. I got my cats dental cleaning done. I called Spot before time and asked if they covered this if my cat has dental disease. I was told yes - if the cleaning is for dental disease they will. I get the cleaning done and I wait a really long time to get my claim done. They reimburse me nothing. I call and ask why and I’m told that it’s a Pre-existing condition. I’m very confused now because this is the first time I’ve ever been told to clean my cats teeth. The lady on the phone sounds slightly judgmental and tells me stage 3 dental disease is incurable so it’s not covered. I called two more times. The last person I talked to was nicer, I asked if she can look through my cats medical records and tell me why it’s a pre-existing condition. It took her a really long time to look that she almost had to contact the claims adjusters. Finally she says in 2018 there is a note that says he has a little bit of tartar on his teeth. Literally all cats over the age of 1 years old have tartar. I wrote a strongly worded email to my vet asking why no one told me to get my cats teeth cleaned before. A few days ago my cat started having a medical emergency. I saw my vet and we talked about it and he tells me that stage 3 dental disease is curable and the cleaning is what cures it. He also thinks the insurance just is doing anything it can to not pay me. I’ve been out of work for 3 months and still paying for this insurance to make sure I can take care of my fur babies but I honestly think it’s hurting me more. I was so overwhelmed at the vet I started crying and my vet even covered a bit of my bill for me - more this insurance has done. I really wish I saved the money I used on this insurance because my cat is not doing well and the vet bills are pilling up. I’m worried they will not help me with any of these bills and by the time I find out I’ll have already wasted more money on them..",4,Pros and Cons,0,2023-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,2023-08-14T11:24:10.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/spotpetins.com?page=142

64d6a0baf06b7e3e3a360837,False,False,"I took out a policy on my dog 3 months ago. I got the accident illness coverage with a 500.00 deductible, and also the gold coverage that covers wellness exams and other things like vaccines. It's barely worth it, but I figured even using one wellness exam I'd get 50.00 back. Even though my dog had just been to the rescue vet 3 months earlier, I took him in for a wellness check. He's a young dog in good health, so my only main reason is because I could do it with no deductible. During the visit the vet noticed a sore in the corner of the dog's mouth. He said he'd put the dog on an antibiotic for a couple of weeks to clear it up. The bill said ""Office Visit"" and ""Doxycycaline"" Then Spot asked for medical records and vet notes. So because the antibiotic was prescribed, they said it wasn't a wellness exam. I argued with 5 different people in one day to no avail. So now that Gold rider I purchased is worthless because my dog has had everything on the list of things they pay a little money on. I asked if I could get my money back on the gold rider, and they said yes, for the time I hadn't used it. I hadn't used it at all! They refused to pay me for the wellness exam so nothing on the policy had been used. I decided to just keep the policy for now because it will just be a loss for me, but I plan to cancel when the first year is up. Talking to these people is like talking to a brick wall and they are just there to steal your money.

I didn't think to write down her name, but she was very courteous and seemed genuinely concerned. She apologized for the person who hung up on me on my previous call and said that the problem had been addressed. She explained that the delay in getting Dudley's vet records on the latest claim was in getting them updated from the ones they'd received previously, which sounded reasonable. 
I am upgrading my rating from 1 to 4 stars. While none of my expenses have been covered as yet, they have replied to my reviews here in a manner that allays at least most, if not all, of my concerns. I will continue using them as my insurer. 

EDIT 8/8/23 I called Spot after they replied here, suggesting I do so. I reiterated my complaints as described below. On the issue of not paying for his vaccinations, they explained that I hadn't paid for preventative care when I purchased the insurance. Fair enough, I'd forgotten that.
On the issue of delaying a decision on my claim for his vaccinations for weeks, claiming they didn't have his records, even though they'd denied two previous claims based on his records, at first he didn't reply. When I repeated the question, HE HUNG UP ON ME! Guess who's going shopping!

Original Post, circa Aug 1:
I subscribed to Spot for insurance on my 11 yr old dachshund a few months ago. So far I've submitted 3 claims totally over $1300 and not a dime of it has been accepted. I'm beginning to think that any ailment he may have is automatically considered a pre-existing condition. This includes his vaccinations which I thought would be covered under preventative medicine (which is specifically named in the policy and on the selection list when you file a claim) though they denied that too. I'm sure that somewhere in the fine print, probably on page 47, that vaccinations, along with everything else that might actually happen, is excluded. The decision on this payment took weeks because they needed his records which they claimed not to have even though both previous claims were denied as existing conditions months earlier. So how did they know they were pre-existing conditions if they didn't yet have his records? I smell a rat!",4,"I subscribed to Spot for insurance on…Jan 17, 2023",0,2023-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,2023-07-31T22:01:43.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/spotpetins.com?page=144

However, they have a 180-day period where if a condition doesn't occur, it is not considered pre-existing. This stood out to me as a positive since pretty much no insurance company allows pre-existing conditions (this is a huge fail with health insurance, pet or human, but that's another conversation). One of my cats needed emergency surgery to remove an eye, and after I submitted the almost $2,000 claim, I found it was rejected/not covered due to it being a pre-existing condition for something that had occurred 220 days prior. One, THIS wasn't related to the other vet visit, at all -- this was an emergency. Two, it was well over the 180-day grace period even if they could try their hardest to related the two. The rep told me that since it was noted on his vet records, it IS considered pre-existing (but it was unrelated??) and it will NOT be covered.

However, when our 1 yr old dog had a yeast infection on his ears due to an allergic reaction from a shampoo, he scratched his body and outside of ears because they were itchy. He then got an atopic infection on outside of ears. It was difficult to resolve as they weren’t sure if it was bacterial or fungus. It took a few visits to get it under control, but it was complete resolved. Spot denied a claim for the last visit to his vet, in which they took cultures and administered both antibiotics and fungus meds. It came to almost $700 because we needed to get this resolved once and for all. The culture from the lab came back that it was indeed yeast. They denied the claim claiming it was a pre-existing condition and also said they would not cover any type of dermatitis he ever got in the future. I appealed with notes from the vet that it was resolved. They said that it seemed he had chronic allergies and they won’t cover it! Dogs get yeast infections. Dogs have allergic reactions.

I am not sure why SPOT has good reviews when my experience was totally opposite. I am a retired nurse, and this is an honest opinion. Took my dog in to the urgent care, because she coughed blooded 2 days earlier. The vet asked me when did I started seeing my dog cough. I told the vet that it could be a couple of months ago due to the Wildfire but that was very minor. Or it could have been the virus from the groomer (being close to other dogs). I wasn't sure. However, this was a loud cough with blood, that has never happened before. The vet couldn't find anything wrong with her. Cough suppressant was prescribed. Found out my family and I had Covid. The illness was considered pre-existing condition because I told the vet that the cough might start from wildfire a couple of month ago. I wrote on the claim that my family had COVID and ready to show proves. They assume that both coughs are related eventhough the professional didn't have the answer. The vet didn't test my dog for COVID as we didn't know we had COVID. The first incident or symptom (pre-existing) should be coughing blood not coughing.

63b1919a2338b6d417acc598,False,False,"Spot was highly recommended to me by several acquaintances.  As a result, I signed up online on Dec 25th for Spot for our 10 mos. old cavachon who is still at the trainer's facility and will be delivered to us Jan 2.  I received a call from Spot a few days later (on Dec 29th) ostensively inquiring about whether we knew how the insurance worked and how to file claims and if we had any questions.  In the course of the conversation, I mentioned that our dog would be delivered on Jan 2nd by the trainer.  The representative harped on the point that the dog was not yet in our full possession and insisted we were not covered since the dog was not yet in our possession.  I explained that the dog is fully owned and paid for by us and I tried to explain this to her, but it made no difference.  She insisted that we had to reset the starting date to Jan 2nd and extend out the waiting period.  The dog is healthy and again recently vet checked and offered to provide her a copy of the vet report. I told her all this, but it made no difference.  

This seemed like a deceptive practice to me as it was not disclosed on the Spot website and the representative from Spot was insistent and not willing to escalate the matter to a higher level.  This made me think that Spot might handle claims if I had any in a similar and deceptive matter to avoid payment.  Had this issue on physical possession of the dog been clearly disclosed on the Spot website, I would have made the initial starting date later.

As a result, I canceled our insurance with Spot and went with another provider.

We just had his blood drawn 10/31, he has to be put under, to double check if this is an issue, it isn’t, and Spot denied the claim. Stating clause 51, which I assume is preexisting condition. They’re employee who I spoke to in February told me that Spot would cover this test, but now $400 later, they won’t. I immediately changed to Lemonade insurance and am canceling Spot tomorrow. They also posted the same reply on this as they do everyone. I don’t need an explanation of what your 21 year old employee decided based on how it will benefit Spot. I need Spot to realize that a possible obstruction (which there wasn’t anything, suggesting my cat simply ate something that affected him adversely) resulting in an X-ray with a possible smaller kidney (turns out his kidneys are fine, based on the test your employee told me would be paid), is not the same thing. Cat eats something and pukes on one occasion ever in his life is not the same thing as cat could have chronic kidney disease, based on an incidental X-ray to see if cat has a ball of yarn in his stomach. Obviously whomever does the claims has no clue about the anatomy of animals. This is Spot taking care of Spot and not taking care of the customer or their beloved pet.

They also seemed to have quite comprehensive coverage, including some common issues with the particular breed of dogs that I own.  This is my second year with SPOT and I have been very pleased with the coverage they have provided for both my boxer puppies.  Unfortunately these two dogs happen to have multiple issues and are frequent flyers at my vet's office; one even needs prescription dog food.  Having SPOT insurance has been a lifesaver to our bank account!  It is easy to file claims online and reimbursements are direct deposited into my account.

61aa84a62b49257fe2944947,False,False,"Stay away from this insurance!!!! I have an 8 month old puppy I rescued from a back yard Tied to a trampoline with no water in the Florida Sun. He was emaciated, and crying. I brought him home, fed and bathed him, then signed him up with Spot for pet insurance on October 21. I signed him up for accident/illness coverage, and was told there was a 10 day waiting period for the company's protection against pre-existing conditions. I called my vet and tried to schedule for an appointment, and the earliest one I could get was for November 9th, so I scheduled it, figuring I had the waiting period to get through. Around Halloween, I noticed that he was squinting his right, and that is was a little red, a couple days later, he stated scratching constantly at his right ear. I bought dog wipes, and cleaned out both ears. He was fine for a couple days, before I noticed he was starting with diarrhea. I called the vet's office, and they told me to give him boiled chicken and white rice because he was emaciated. November 9th I took him for his visit. He had an eye infection, an ear infection, and hookworm. They cleaned ans packed his ears, gave him a shot for hookworm, and treated his eye. They also gave him his puppy vaccinations. I was prescribed medication for all three illnesses and we were sent home with a two week follow up scheduled on November 22nd. The next morning, I filed the claim, and gave a brief description of what was going on. The vet bill was $465, $159 of that was for his vaccinations, which I knew was not covered under his plan. The claim took 3 weeks to process, and Spot blamed it on the vet, saying they never sent the info over to them. my vet showed me proof that they sent it over twice. The claim was finally processed, and 3 of the 4 categories listed were under accident/Illness, which left a total of $306 dollars which was not reimbersed. I called Spot to inquire about this, and they told me that the illness started before the waiting period was over. I told them I waited 19 days to take him to the vet. I am not a vet, and I could not diagnose him if there was an illness! That's why i took him to the vet!!!! they told me the illness occurred before the end of the waiting period, therefore, it was not covered because it was considered a pre-existing condition! Really. I paid my premium, went through the waiting period, and my dog got sick before his vet appointment, and it's a pre-existing condition???? They use technicalities to the limit!!! I am not a vet!!! I should have lied in the box where they asked what was going on. They lied, why cant I?   Spot feeds you the line that they are all about pet awareness, then they pull this??? THEY ARE LIARS, AND THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF!!!! Do not rescue a dog with this insurance!!!! If you do, lie about everything, or you won't be covered!!!! I am cancelling this policy and going with a different pet insurance. I know his second claim for his follow up, which is still in processing after a week, will be denied. Do your homework before buying pet insurance!!! My health plan doesn't pull this crap when I file a claim!!! Ive gone to my local news station, and they are doing an investigation on Spot, and their reimbursement policies! Stay tuned...

Update: they are very so sorry for my bad experience, and that is never easy to reject a claim. I should call the customer service number, and they will explain why my claim was denied. DON’T GET THIS INSURANCE!!!! I called the customer, and they explained their decision, and I repeat what I said before. THEY ARE LIARS AND THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF!!! Do not expected to be reimbursed for your claim! They will give you every excuse as for why they denied your claim!!!  Nothing has Changed!!! I am going to go with Pumpkin Pet insurance. They really care about both you and your pet! They promote pet wellness. Spot will just take your money, lie to you, and screw you!!!

That means that I ended up paying $3400 in total for the vet bill and pet insurance and will receive only $150 back. What I have found out after doing extensive research on pet insurance, is that its not worth it. Many insurances don't cover lab fees, x-rays or medications so when you end up paying a large bill you think you are going to get 80% back. That's not the case, make sure to look at what the insurance covers and their policy on preexisting condition.  They will find any excuse to not cover majority of the cost, but what can you do? You already have to pay the full cost up front! and then you have to wait and see if some of it will be reimbursed??  If I had done better research I would have started a savings account where I could have put the same amount as the monthly premium into that account and made sure to have a credit card that I could use to cover the cost.  I ended up paying an extra $1100 when I could have saved that money to pay towards my dog's dental procedure!  They made an almost 100% profit. Pet insurance is definitely a scam.

6041aaeef85d75039420e515,False,False,"All the reviews looked great until I actually received this insurance. I took my dog in for a tummyache during the first two week waiting period, and understood he couldn’t get it covered during that time. However, I was shocked to hear that SPOT pet insurance we consider that a pre-existing condition. That’s right...an upset stomach from eating grass (new dog owner so didn’t know this is common), is considered pre-existing condition, which meant that for the next SIX months they wouldn’t cover any medical accident or ill as involving his stomach. And then, when I politely asked to cancel my insurance, I got an automated response telling me that it was canceled. Yes that is what I wanted, but to not receive a personalized message or at least an attempt to keep me as a customer or understand the problem was wildly disappointing. Would absolutely not recommend.

EDIT: in response to their response, It’s one thing to respect a user’s desire to cancel, but whether a company tries to keep their customers and actually fix their issues before letting them go says a lot about their customer service philosophy. And regarding the pre-existing conditions, the issue is the fact that you would consider an isolated upset stomach situation as a pre-existing condition.

We purchased the policy when my puppy was 3 months old. He got into trouble and swallowed rocks twice: once before and once during the insurance waiting period. The first time, he went to the ER for an endoscopy to remove them from his stomach. The second time the Dr made him puke it out. He had diarrhea for a couple weeks after due to all these procedures, but it went away after some time. It was all paid out of pocket ($4K) because the policy wasn’t active at this time. Too bad timing didn’t work out but that was the rules we agreed to, no hard feelings there.

After the waiting period was over, our dog started causing destruction around the house when left alone. He bit entire corners off the walls and literally ate two holes through the wall when left alone inside a gated kitchen for less than 1 hr. We consulted with the vet and they wrote a letter diagnosing separation anxiety and recommending behavioral treatment, which SPOT claims is covered.

We submitted the letter from the Dr and letter from an animal behaviorist outlining a treatment plan to SPOT for approval. They denied coverage claiming that eating rocks when he’s with us is a sign of separation anxiety and is therefore a pre-existing condition. I argued it is unreasonable to claim that a behavior observed when accompanied is a symptom of separation anxiety, but they disagreed. They also disagreed with the Dr’s letter that, literally and word by word, states the diagnosis for separation anxiety is unrelated to eating rocks. SPOT formulated their own diagnosis for my dog that justifies rejection of coverage and denied the claim.
 
At some point the diarrhea came back and lasted for weeks. The vet put him on medication for a month but wasn’t getting better so they recommended doing a full blood panel to diagnose any physical issues. SPOT rejected coverage for the vet’s medication, the blood panel and diagnostic tests claiming that because he had diarrhea before, it is a pre-existing condition and no treatment would be covered.
