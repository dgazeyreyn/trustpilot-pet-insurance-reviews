Of this only the initial check up was covered by Lemonade as they claim the tumours were a pre existing condition and so nothing else was covered. Even the vet recommended euthanasia that is covered in the policy was not covered because it was a pre existing condition.

Of the $1700 treatment on March 12th only $44 was covered despite the treatment being a direct result of a check up on March 7th.

There was no mention of earthquake retrofitting when submitting the initial set of renewal photos in the app. 

The correct way to handle this is to work with the customer so that they are within compliance in order to maintain their policy and keep them as a customer. Instead they abruptly stated that they wont renew our policy due to vague explanations that give us little insight on what to do to maintain our policy. Now rather than having a customer, I'm fully invested in getting a policy with a different insurance provider and intend to make sure anyone who asks knows to avoid this bottom dwelling company.

65e121de19d89963c655fa53,False,False,"I was a customer of Lemonade pet insurance for a little over a year (12/22-2/24). I took my dog to the vet at the beginning of February. He was diagnosed with IVDD 2/15/24. They didn't cover it because they said it was  a preexisting condition. My dog was never at any point diagnosed with IVDD in the past. I requested the medical records from the vet and found on 8/22 (A year and a half earlier) I took him to the vet because he was having issues with his back leg. The vet told me to take him home, give him some pain meds and let him rest for a few days. At no point was there any mention of him having IVDD. In his medical records the vet made a note it may have to do with IVDD. Again no diagnosis was given, No Xrays were done showing he had IVDD, he was not treated for IVDD. There is absolutely NOTHING that says my dog had IVDD back in 2022. The Vet did not discuss the possibility with me that he may have IVDD. He was sent home with a clean bill of health. Just a note the doctor made is what they used as a reason to call it a pre existing condition and deny my claim. This is not good insurance. They will not cover you. They are going to find any reason possible NOT to cover you. I immediately cancelled the policies for both of my dogs. Complete waste of money.

Despite providing receipts and photos confirming that my roof was replaced in 2019, Lemonade denied coverage based on cosmetic discoloration, which has no impact on the roof's functionality.

This experience has led me to question Lemonade's policies further. It appears that Lemonade may accept new homes for insurance policies for the first term, only to end coverage later to avoid liabilities or payouts for older homes.

I find Lemonade's approach disappointing and unfair. It seems they prioritize avoiding payouts over providing genuine coverage and support to their customers. Based on my experience, I cannot recommend Lemonade for home insurance and urge others to carefully consider their options before choosing Lemonade.

65cff90c0f3d913675d16b9e,False,False,"Initially I was pleased with Lemonade. It was very easy to sign up, and it wasn't very spendy for renter's insurance. Things were great, then I had to file a claim.

My house flooded due to a burst water pipe. The whole main level of my rental had standing water. I filed a claim with Lemonade, which was a little cumbersome, but I did it, and they sent out an adjuster. Because the pipe burst in the garage to the water heater, it was pretty high up in the garage, and also ran down the wall causing water in the whole main level. Water got all over in my tools and the house smelled pretty bad.

Unfortunately, Lemonade would only provide a small amount of money for all of my tools that got rusted, and failed to provide any money for several things that got damaged due to soaking up water. Because I didn't have a lot of money due to having to move as a result, I had to bring some of that furniture with me to my new place, which I ended up having to get rid of because it brought the bad smell over to my new home. Even though the claim amount they paid was way under the amount of insurance I had, they unfortunately didn't provide enough for me to replace my damaged property. They expected that I only clean the area rugs, which had shrunk and become rippled due to the water, and just generally not looking as crisp as they had, kind of like how old carpet starts to look even if you clean it. As I have started using my rusted tools after cleaning with CLR as they had proposed I do, they all have broken on the next real use because the rust damaged their integrity. Some of the power tools that got wet initially functioned, but after the next use under normal operating conditions they have overheated and generally not provided the strength they used to.

They essentially asserted that a whole lot of my stuff that got wet and damaged wasn't in need of replacement because it was only cosmetic or still was operational based on just plugging it in and turning it on. Unfortunately, the water damage resulted had lasting effects that made the property unusable for it's intended purpose. Much like a car that gets flooded can work, there are a whole bunch of problems with them when you actually try to use them normally, which is why insurances pay to replace them and consumers are cautioned against purchasing cars that have been subject to flooding.

I don't use Lemonade. I do not recommend them anymore.",1,Initially I was pleased with Lemonade,1,2023-12-06T00:00:00.000Z,2024-02-17T02:08:44.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/lemonade.com?page=7

We live in San Diego, and the recent rainstorms flooded many parts of the city to a point where people were paddle-boarding on the streets (was all over social media).

Our (rented) house flooded. The water damage was a lot more severe than expected, so our Property Manager asked us to vacate for 3 weeks up to a month for repairs.

THE PROBLEM IS: I am 7 months pregnant (yes, I had just finished my nursery when this happened) and we need to vacate ASAP, not just for the workers, but for my and my baby’s health. We started a claim with them, only to find out a few days later that they don’t cover flood/rain damage. So here, we are, trying to figure out where we are going to stay for a month with our 3 dogs while my baby is measuring in the 98th percentile and is looking to arrive several weeks early.

Why do we even have this insurance if it doesn’t cover us when we need it? When are house IS considered unlivable due to mold, sewage from the flood, etc?

65abea6e66362c52e08e2817,False,False,"REVIEWS 
The points below have been reported to the Texas Dept of insurance and a letter sent to the CEO 

Daniel Schreiber 
New York, 5 Crosby St. 3rd floor, United States,
daniel.schreiber (AT) lemonade (DOT) com

He has completely IGNORED the ISSUES of his company. No surprises, the stock has lost 99.9% of its value. It is a LEMON

After 2 years of using the car insurance Lemonade, here are the summaries of the issues, which this company has shown.
Given the useless resolutions of the “customer care” which does not really resolve anything, we have also had to escalate them to the CEO 

1) Constant harassing customer service and APP, with reminders to check their online services. The customer service has confirmed that: 
“Lemonade has serious technical issues, and the location services disconnect after::
•	Any App update
•	Anytime the phone goes in flight mode. (if you are flying, be ready to respond to them upon landing, by reactivating their tracking services, so they know where you are. Your other things (i.e.: get a Uber, get my luggage, get out of the airport, get to my meeting, getting to my hotel,) are irrelevant to them. Your job is to fix their broken App
•	Randomly. No precise reasons.

The customer is held responsible for those disconnections and gets harassed if they do not take action. The customers will eventually get a penalty for not complying to fix the Lemonade IT issues. After one week of harassment lemonade will charge the customer additional US$ on their insurance premium

2) Lemonade refuses to share with the customers the details of their travels in the USA and abroad, by using the technique of: Ignore.

3) The app is designed to track and charge every single movement of the people under the policy and charging miles accordingly.
This includes: walking, riding a bike, driving a vehicle or a moped (covered by another insurance), being a passenger in a Taxi, Uber, friend’s car. It tracks and registers steps done in own home, across rooms, in the back and front yard, etc

4) Patronizing behavior shown by many contact center employees, and in an amplified way by “managers”, who use the “threaten and blame the customer “technique.",1,Even the CEO ignores what happens at his company,2,2023-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,2024-01-20T17:44:47.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/lemonade.com?page=14

65986fe5f39403f5623d7a8c,False,False,"We signed up for Lemonade car insurance in June 2022. We liked their tech, the process was easy and the rates were cheap.

However, the experience has steadily gotten worse and the rate has steadily climbed. We're now paying more than twice what we were when we started, despite them declaring that we're top-tier drivers.

I'm a little too lazy to write a full review right now, so here are the pros and cons:

Pros:

* Clean interface
* Easy to contact someone in the event of a roadside incident
* Fairly smooth claims process

Cons:

* They try hard not to actually talk to you, always shoving you through their stupid chatbot, which doesn't work very well
* They give basically ZERO access to any relevant account information if you're not the primary insured. I take care of most of our admin stuff, but my partner is the primary, and I always have to have her do things instead of being able to do them myself
* They offer basically zero records of your activity online. I tried to find our claims history and had to call them (even logged in as my partner).
* They make it easy for you to accidentally make changes to your account that permanently increase your premium without warning you. We did this several times and ended up reverting to our previous coverage, only to be charged much more for it because we now had records of changes on the account....
* They put claims on our permanent record that we never actually ended up submitting. We did start the claims, but then canceled them when we found out how little we would receive. However, they ended up on our record anyway and are now impacting future policies.

In short, I think they've got good intentions but they're not there yet. They're not mature enough to continue with, and the prices are definitely not low enough to justify the trouble.",2,"A strong start, but ultimately frustrating",1,2024-01-05T00:00:00.000Z,2024-01-05T23:08:54.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/lemonade.com?page=15

656a716951e780de61c7cb77,False,False,"I purchased homeowner's insurance from Lemonade two years ago when I bought my house. The buying process went smoothly and the people I spoke with were friendly and accommodating.  Anytime thereafter, if I had a question or concern, I was always happy with the customer service I received. 

Then, out of nowhere this past summer, I received an email from Lemonade requesting pictures of my roof and of the sticker on my water heater (to establish its age), making it clear that the renewal of my homeowner’s policy was contingent upon receipt of these pictures. After providing what was asked for, I received notice that Lemonade would not be renewing my policy stating: “Our guidelines specify that we aren’t able to cover homes with water heaters outside of their usable lifespan or a roof condition that does not meet our standards of maintenance.” 

Based on pictures only, they determined that my roof did not meet their standards – the same roof that two years prior was just fine (Note: the single layer of shingles on my roof received a good grade and was described as being “less than half of their maximum life expectancy” by the home inspector who examined them during the buying process). Question. Wouldn’t something deemed “outside of [its] usable lifespan” be something that is no longer usable; as in it no longer works? My water heater, which again was just fine 24 months ago, was suddenly an issue big enough to warrant non-renewal of my insurance policy unless replaced. Who replaces a water heater, or something like that, based solely on its estimated life expectancy? Nobody does! When it starts acting up or stops working, that’s when it gets replaced. Mine works fine, shows no signs of wear or rust or any soon-to-fail red flags. And as I told the agent at Lemonade, even if it were to fail - water pouring out all over - it is in a section of my basement that purposefully has a drain directly next to it should such a disaster happen. Regardless, Lemonade insisted that these two critical issues were of such magnitude as to warrant severing ties with me. 

Something seemed off; something still does. I asked several homeowner friends if they’d ever experienced or heard of anything similar and nobody had, and everyone thought it was really odd. I even ran the scenario by insurance agents I spoke with while getting quotes for a new policy and they seemed genuinely confused by it as well. 

It initially seemed like Lemonade had a good thing going as a relative newcomer in the insurance world but, their new spin on an old model doesn’t seem to be all that it was hoped to be. It’s been said, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. In this case, however, I’m just going to grab the vodka and the sugar and make lemon drops.",1,Lemonade terminated my homeowner's policy under odd circumstances.,2,2023-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,2023-12-02T01:51:05.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/lemonade.com?page=17

Sadly this was a bad mistake and one that I will never repeat.
Sadly I recently had an accident which resulted in damage to my ultra wide computer monitor. I claimed on my Lemonade poicy and that’s when it all went down hill. The superfast claims process is non existent. 
The problem seems to be that I had the misfortune to make this claim in the third month of my policy.
Lemonade wrote back and asked for further photos and description of the events leading to the claim which is fair enough. They also asked for the details of the policy I held prior to lemonade. I thought this strange but provided policy details and the company I had been insured with.
The next reply from Lemonade then asked me to forward a copy of my previous insurance certificate before they can move forward with the claim. 
The reason they cite is and this is a cut and paste 
“ Because your date of loss and policy inception date are so close we are looking for proof that you held another contents insurance policy when your Lemonade policy was purchased.”
I have checked and nowhere can I see terms and conditions stating you can only insure with Lemonade if you were insured prior to taking out insurance with them.
This seems 
1. Reasonable
2. It makes me feel like I am being treated as a fraudster
My previous insurers operated an online portal for viewing documents which is closed after the insurance is not renewed. I have contacted them and they will send it but it can take 10 days further delaying my claim and the time I cannot use my PC.

When I called to cancel they said sure, but we have to charge for 2 months prior, stating it's prorated and apparently they covered me (without my approval of course).  So, after they ignored my request to cancel my renewal they said ""sure, we can cancel it but we can't tell you how much we would refund you.""

650ca47b698fc0be3ea27c31,False,False,"Lemonade is convenient, but the service aspects have felt disappointing. We enjoy the app interface for getting things done like a new policy, but do not enjoy surprises of actually engaging with their services when needed. For example, prior to a recent claim, we were deciding on options for increasing our coverage. I made some changes to the policy and saved it to see what the price differences would be; later we removed the changes we did not want (car rental coverage), but left other changes (decreased deductible amount). Only to realize Lemonade had increased our premium because we experimented with policy changes. INSANE! the app allows you to ""play"" so to speak with these changes. There were no warnings about how this might affect my premium and now it is higher  simply because I was exploring different coverage options after realizing we needed more coverage. We have enjoyed lemonade for the ease of use ... until we had to use it beyond the app. The process of submitting a claim start to finish, was easy and then became awful in terms of clarity, communication, and professionalism.  

It's been very disappointing and we are currently planning to end our coverage in the coming months!

Separately - the app has pretty regular issues with the gps/location and we often got emails saying our car insurance policy would be terminated if we did not turn our gps/location back on so the app could track our driving. We always had it on. We always had to email them and ask for support on this. We never learned why it kept happening and just had to deal with the nuisance.

Update: After researching new insurance companies, we learned that lemonade rep erroneously submitted a claim on our account that we called them about, but ultimately decided not to submit the claim.

Opened another with the correct date - special investigations unit gets involved and the person I spoke to on the phone couldn’t understand dates and times because of the verbiage of “morning” when referring to AM before Dawn.

Ok. I have renter's insurance with Lemonade, so far so good. 
BUT I decided to get a quote for auto insurance. I went through all the hoops, gathered all the paperwork they wanted, and got a quote. 
Mind you a policy was NOT in effect yet. 
They gave me a quote for 6 months - at no time did they say ""pay now"", ""must pay in full now"" etc. Nothing. 
I find in my bank, they took out $415 from our card on file, AND NO POLICY EVEN EXISTED YET. 
Now my bank is in the red. Ugh. 
*
Their response was E**** from Lemonade here.
 
I apologize if the payment caught you off guard. However, when signing up for a Lemonade Car policy you will be charged the price you see on your quote screen when you finish creating your policy.
*
See? It's a QUOTE screen, I hadn't ""signed up"" yet, there was NO policy ""created"", in fact you get a pop up notation ""your car is not insured yet""... it doesn't say that you must pay in full NOW. There's no payment options, which is what we needed for our budget. 
I decided to stick with my current car insurance, and am also checking in to some other renter's.

A couple of days later and you'll get your claim finalised (yes/no) and then money transferred a few days after that. It is THAT simple.

64a9864025bd4216fc9202eb,False,False,"I would give zero stars if i could

I have a Pet Preventative Care Add-On with my Accident and Illness Policy with Lemonade Insurance.  I filed a wellness visit claim for my dog which is covered under the Preventative Care Add-On on the insurance policy.

After I submitted the Preventative Care Claim, Lemonade changed my claim to an illness visit, stating they did this because probiotics were on the invoice.  I did not even file the probiotics as part of the claim, I only filed the preventative care items.  They took it upon themselves to change the claim based on the invoice.  They also added in that he was “not eating/decreased eating, anorexia/Gastrointestinal Issues” which is not found in any of his veterinarian records for this visit, nor any visit in the past year.  Since when does an 85-pound dog classify as anorexic?  His veterinarian records show he has gained five pounds since his last visit.  Clearly not anorexic.

When they processed the claim, they applied the preventative care items to the $250 deductible.  His policy clearly shows that preventative items are covered and are reimbursable.  I even received an email from the claims adjuster on June 28, 2023 assuring me that I would be reimbursed for all preventative care items.

However, rather than reimburse me for those items as the policy states, they have applied these amounts to his annual deductible, leaving those items as still available to be utilized under his policy.  They refuse to pay these items that are clearly covered under the Preventative Care Add-On.",1,I would give zero stars if i could,0,2023-06-23T00:00:00.000Z,2023-07-08T17:52:32.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/lemonade.com?page=28

Of course, they blame us, the policyholder, for this recurring problem, which happens every 2-3 months, sometimes more often.  They send us emails that we are location disabled, when we ARE location enabled -- they then send messages threatening to charge (reverse) our discounts (due to their own errors)!!  WHAT?  We did NOTHING to change our location settings, and immediately correct THEIR problems, by constantly checking our location permissions, but they have the right to take our money anyhow?  NO.  Then, they claim that whenever WiFi goes out or there is a power outage, the locations are disabled -- but that is a lie, because we have tested their theory, and this does not happen ... and also doesn't happen with both policyholders when they are sitting side by side, which proves that Lemonade's theory is wrong.  No, the problem is on THEIR END.  We are SO sick of getting weekly or sometimes daily notifications from MAYA that we are offline, and then clicking and her telling us (in the SAME message) ""You're all set"" and then being forced to click ""AWESOME"" :(

In April, we realized they charged us, admitted it was an error, but never reversed it ... so we had to take yet MORE valuable time to convince them to give us the $30+ refund (they still owe us $5).  All of this (threat to reverse our discounts and charge us) happens every 2-3 months. Today, 7/6/23, after two days of back and forth and emailing them, they again threatened to take our discounts and charge us $86+ while our location permissions ARE ENABLED.  We've been dealing with this nonsense for more than a year, and are finally fed up and switching back to conventional insurance, for a mere $10 per month more!!  Their rates are NOT THAT AFFORDABLE anymore, as they keep raising them.

First, the claim was for an illness (Giardia) that our dog had previously had before he was covered by the policy and for which he was completely cured. Their policy excludes cured conditions from their usual rule against covering pre-existing conditions. However, Lemonade found because he had had Giardia over the past year, they denied the claim. This was despite the fact that Giardia is like a human cold, with any infection being completely unrelated to a subsequent infection. 

Second, when you file a claim with Lemonade they ""offer"" you a call to discuss. When I took my claim reviewers (Johnny Ensell and Carie Chuma) up on their offer, they ignored my repeated attempts to discuss and rejected the claim without ever following-up.

We've had our dog insured with Lemonade since the beginning. The routine care coverage is comprehensive, although I did mess up getting his vaccines twice within the same coverage year, so something to keep an eye on.

However dogs will always find a way to do something dumb, which is why insurance is a must have for your pet as a responsible owner. Our dog managed to have an allergic reaction to a bee he ate, and tore a nail off playing fetch. Both initial treatment and followups have been covered, and I've always been confident rushing to the vets that I don't have to worry about paperwork/networks.

Their claim process is simple and fast through the app, and gives you a choice to submit invoices by line item, or just send it over and get their help breaking it down. I often have to rely on the latter as I try to decipher a vet bill.

You can find cheaper insurance options, but I can promise your pet will find someway to make you pay way more anyway. Lemonade's terms definitely avoid that.",5,Peace of mind,0,2023-01-08T08:00:00.000Z,2023-01-09T03:19:04.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/lemonade.com?page=35

63b5ff502338b6d417b0295d,False,False,"Initially I liked this company's pet insurance but between them not 'fully' paying for things because of 'loopholes' and continued policy increases (2023 increased by 29% from 2022) it makes more sense to just put away money into a separate account.

Submissions are all via the app which is okay, however, the first time I needed to file a claim it took weeks to get reimbursed.  They then try to make you jump through hoops to get a copy of the Vet 'notes' from the chart but I always not tell them that 'they can call and get it themselves'.  

They don't cover the initial pet exam fee which is similar to you paying your 'copayment' if you go to a doctor, however, what they fail to tell you is that vets all charge this different and/or can combine charges so while it 'may' partially be an exam fee it often times can be a fee that is both an exam fee but something is also performed.  For example, they did not reimburse when I brought my dog BACK to the vet to get stitches out simply because the vet does charge a 'Office Visit - level 2' but it includes the cost of removing sutures which is a line item below it, but it says the cost is 'included' in the office visit charge.  So they refuse to even consider the fact that the office visit was to remove sutures and not for an exam.  So you end up getting NOTHING back!

I can give many examples like this, they simply look for loopholes to NOT give you money back and their customer service is all online which means no one is really answering your complaints.

I would switch companies but unfortunately I have this policy for 2 dogs and both have had 'some' claims in 2022 so anything related in the future would be declined be a different company.

632f8c1ec17abd5d3c38c4c3,False,False,"BEWARE. I have had Lemonade for the past few years, and used to rave about them. I heard they are losing money and raising rates so possibly this is why they are changing, but how did they donate so much in unused payouts last year? (Which was one of the features I loved) Recently, it seems since Covid, things have changed. I never filed a claim, nor for years before I was with Lemonade, and always paid on time. They seemed so nice - maybe too nice? But then in late Spring of 2022 I was working less due to Covid and when I went into my Lemonade account, I got a message saying ""You can take up to 60 days to pay your premium"" now because of Covid, and ""We also extended our grace period."" I thought ""these people are amazing!"" Well, I didn't use the 60 days, but I felt no pressure and did pay the day after and a couple days after my normal due date knowing I had more time for a few months. I took screenshots of Lemonade's messages and kept copies of the emails I received, so I have proof. Well, I just got a notice that they have decided to not renew my policy because of ""uneven payments"" - I contacted them, and apparently their management was not talking with their underwriters because the rude gentlemen in the underwriting department I spoke with insisted that you can't be late at all, even when I showed them proof that Lemonade offered people more time. They had no interest in hearing it or discussing it. This ""uneven payments"" was the only reason they gave. I never filed any claims and never was late (before what they now call late because it barely went past the normal due date by a couple days, which they offered and encouraged way more than that). So, Lemonade basically told people they had extended their grace period and had 60 days to pay when they really didn't. I would have been much more vigilant if I hadn't depended on that offer they gave me. I imagine other people will find out they were duped and get dropped, as well, which makes it harder to get insurance from another provider. I will be contacting the state insurance regulators to report my experience with Lemonade's very misleading and possibly illegal behavior. You shouldn't be able to renege and penalize people for simply taking advantage of an offer you chose to make. Don't trust them - they aren't good for their word. They're clearly mismanaged.

624f8bfe2b3c3c43cfcc4d74,False,False,"Honest Lemonade Pet Insurance Review

I want to start off by saying Vanessa was AMAZING and so SWEET she handled my claim and did everything she could to try and help me. 

However, I would think twice before getting pet insurance or specifically upgrading to the Preventive Care Package with Lemonade.

I LOVED Lemonade as a company! I have my home owners insurance through them and HAD my pet insurance through them. I loved how easy the app was! 

Before insurance started my dog Paxton had his physical exam and lemonade got all his records and everything seemed fine and was going smoothly. The I preventive care package includes shots, heart worm medications, one yearly dental cleaning, and blood work. So of course when I saw the dental cleaning coverage I was sold!! That is the most expensive part about preventive care so of course I would do it. 

Well, I scheduled his dental consultation and sent in the receipt and it took 2 full months for them to look over the dental cleaning claim. I thought that was a long time just for a dental cleaning. Well while the dental cleaning was being preformed the vet called me and said he had one infected tooth and it would be $65 to remove it and they would just pull it out during his routine dental cleaning so he wouldn't have to have anesthesia twice. I agreed to that. 

Lemonade Contacted me saying they will not be able to cover the visit because he had Periodontal Disease…. So I said okay well I don’t mind paying full for the tooth  being pulled but you are still going to cover the dental cleaning? They said they are going to DENY the dental cleaning and I will have to pay in full. ($400) 

But when I asked even if he didn’t have periodontal disease he would still need a dental cleaning once a year right? Because that is what the vet recommends for all dogs? They said I understand what you are saying. So what I got from that is that a teeth cleaning should be routine once a year EVEN if the dog doesn’t have periodontal disease. I felt mislead because I was never told what would not be covered based on his record. How would I know a routine dental cleaning wouldn’t be covered!? It’s ROUTINE for every dog even if they have no issues!! I completely understand paying for the tooth being pulled because that is from the Periodontal Disease so I was happy to pay for that but to pay in full for the routine once a year dental cleaning!?! Even though my policy INCLUDES one routine yearly dental cleaning. 

That was a 🚩 for me and I decided to cancel and share my experience so someone else will not be mislead and pay for something that says COVERED when it is NOT. 

I would request after you submit the records of your pet for them to send you a list of what IS actually covered and what is NOT covered. That way there won’t be ANY gray area and it will just be black and white like it should be! I recommended Lemonade to everyone I knew!! Not anymore!! Hopefully this will help the company be more clear to their customers. Most of us aren’t Veterinarians or familiar enough to know what’s covered based on a pet exam. 

I would look into ManyPets for pet insurance. I have friends who use them and said they are great and cover dental cleaning even if he the dog has periodontal disease because it’s a ROUTINE procedure that every dog is recommended to get yearly.",1,Honest Lemonade Pet Insurance Review,3,,2022-04-08T01:12:30.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/lemonade.com?page=52

Sure, you can sign up for insurance super quickly, a little too easily through their automated system, and get a decent price for a monthly payment, but in reality all you're doing is lining an unethical corporation's pockets. When it comes to that unfortunate day you actually need to use the insurance and make a claim, expect a full run around. For one, you cannot speak with a human being to save your life. Everything is through their AI ""assistant"" on the app. The claims process is strange, does not cover all the possible requests, you are unable to speak with a human, you have to record videos of yourself, very strange, detached process that is clearly poising the company in a position to deny your claim. I ended up deleting the claim because it would not let me claim loss of use in an emergency situation that required prompt turn around time. Instead the app would only let me claim damaged items, the least of my concern since only a few towels got damaged but the apartment had become temporarily unlivable and the landlord was not responding, so I needed to make a claim for loss of use for a place to stay. The process seemed so sketchy that I reached out to customer service via email (the only option) and after a few frustrating days trying to get an empathetic and qualified human being on the phone, I cancelled the policy. The customer service rep was rude, dismissive, inappropriately informal, unhelpful in the situation, said nothing of substance or value, and encouraged me to cancel. I finally got a supervisor by request... still only through email, who expanded on Lemonade's claims process, pretty much stating it is the way it is and then encouraging me to cancel, confirming it being impossible to reach somebody, being unable to process a claim with a licensed agent, the disinterest in the emergency situations of their customers, the likelihood a claim would be denied anyway, the reimbursement nature of the policy, the sketchy fine print, all of it. I went through with the cancel.  I looked further at the reviews on the app store and BBB and it is a very clear consensus that this company is shady and will go above and beyond to NOT protect you, pets, or property in a time of need. I need rental insurance that provides actual piece of mind, so I will be going with a larger, more established company, not one that uses an exacerbated AI process, who cannot process a claim efficiently, and who never pay anything out to the insured who are paying in, touting bogus excuses as to why. It's a shame how this company is preying upon lower income households and younger people, their clear target audience.

Their “AI” Claims process is woefully in adequate in almost every way. They expect you to have everything at your disposal, but don’t tell you what you need to have in front of you before starting the filing process and there’s no way to save the process to come back at a later date. 

There’s no way to talk to a real human being and if you call them, they say use the app.

5f7de9a9798e6f0784a7eec3,False,False,"Lemonade was not my insurer. They provided renter's insurance for one of my downstairs neighbors when I lived in an apartment earlier this year. My downstairs neighbor started a negligent kitchen fire in February, causing severe smoke damage to all our belongings. I dealt with all the right channels. Lemonade sent out an adjuster to estimate the damage. I had a company come out to give me a quote. I got the go-ahead from Lemonade to have my belongings treated. In May, my Lemonade claims adjuster asked if I wanted the check sent to me, or to have it sent directly to the restoration company. I said to send it to restoration company.

The money never got sent. I received a past-due notice from the restoration company in August. I called Lemonade again to ask why they hadn't sent the check yet. They said that my ""claims adjuster"" was in a meeting and would call me back. She never called me back. I thought it would be taken care of this time.

In October, I received another notice from the restoration company that they still had not gotten paid. They were now threatening to send the bill to a collections company, which would seriously impact my credit over a bill Lemonade agreed to pay months ago. I had to call Lemonade again. And the fire was in February (eight months ago) and Lemonade explicitly agreed to pay for everything in May (five months ago). It is beyond absurd that it has taken so long to get this resolved (and I still don't know if it is actually resolved this time!!). I felt like I was the one being punished for my neighbor's negligent cooking fire, which could have killed me (I literally got trapped on the fourth floor of a burning building) and made all my belongings reek.

5f0e06b33f06f20bb4b166a1,False,False,"This company is ""fake AI based insurance""

This AI/chatbot based is fake thing as eventually they direct questions to human customer service rep who takes 3 -4 days to get back every time. Have been spending almost 6-7 weeks to get policy cancelled on previous rental unit  and they still keep charging, I told and got email confirmation for cancellation for 15th June as last covered day, they carried to 15th July, kept charging me and now said it was miscommunication on their part and to resolve I need to submit more proofs that the insurance was needed during this extra 1 month. Ridiculous.

Also the new rental place quote I got was $5 higher than the one I got through Geico which eventually paired with Lemonade which gave lower quote so seems being a loyal customer doesn't get you cheaper quote but going through established companies they give lower. 

The premise of this insurance is AI so please don't give the reasons of COVID causing delay for resolution in email replies. I am tired of it. I can buy this reason from other insurance but not form Lemon.",1,"This company is ""fake AI based…",1,,2020-07-14T19:25:39.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/lemonade.com?page=65

A few days later I received an email to say there was likely to be a delay, of a couple of weeks, due to growing issues in China, and was asked if I was still happy to wait. I replied that I was happy to wait. A couple of weeks passed and I received another email from Lemonade saying that it was looking unlikely thar my trainers would be coming any tine soon, again, due to the China situation. I was offered the chance to have a full refund or a different pair of shoes and was provided with 4 pairs to choose from with full links to the images and they were all quite similar to the ones I wanted originally . I thought this was excellent customer service. Not only had I been communicated with, without a prompt from me, but I was so impressed by the thoughtful gesture of offering a close alternative. 

I chose an alternative pair of trainers and they arrived within 2 days AND Lemonade included a free pen too, to apologise for the delay. On top of that, the trainers were lovely - they looked exactly as they did in the online picture and they were SO comfortable. I meant to thank the lovely girls at Lemonade at the time, but events have taken over a bit. So, belated thanks.
