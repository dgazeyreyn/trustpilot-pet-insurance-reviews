The first claim was denied because the coverage started a day after - fine, I understand that one. The problem cleared up completely, but came back a couple weeks later. I took my pet back to the vet and the problem fell into the “recheck” window. They don’t make you pay full price for an illness check if it’s within a certain amount of time. The claim was denied this time due to “pre-existing” condition, even though the problem was resolved after the first vet visit. It seems like this insurance is going to find any reason to not reimburse. The price of insurance is very high compared to other places (and a lot of companies offer pet insurance now) and considering I haven’t had a good experience, I won’t be renewing it.

Originally, she was put on a Lifetime Limit  for her allergy shots.. and once we hit that limit, we were told even if we updated the coverage.. that since we hit the limit for that specifically, it would no longer be covered. We stayed on the insurance because, compared to others, it covered a lot. 

After a while, the premium went up and we worried that we were paying more than we were getting back, and it wasn't very worth it. Our pup had to get allergy shots every month which was close to $150 each time (because she's a GSD), and since it wasn't being covered anymore... it was a lot for us. Our dog visits the vet pretty often due to bad allergies and the occasional extra things. It really adds up. 

Today, I spoke with a representative named Kat and explained our situation. Getting the allergy shots covered was priority since no other insurance would cover (due to it being a Preexisting Condition). Kat understood and walked me through their contract and a workaround in order to have the shots covered again. They were extremely patient and understanding. I was also recommended some small changes to help save money but still get the best coverage considering the current issues we've been facing. It involved getting a new policy entirely which, yes, there's a waiting period before certain stuff can be covered, but we think it's overall worth it in the long run.

That is false, they only pay up to your per pet incident which my per incident was $500. Her surgery was $1800 they paid 120.22 because they said that they had already paid out $377.78 when she was treated for the swollen eye. So don't fall for the surgery being covered.

5faeac465e693f0acce7cffc,False,False,"Update as of 12/22/20 ... it took over a month to appeal the decision on the original decline and the adjuster still declined payment. The tests were run to ensure our dog had not ingested a toxin. The vet updated the records stating that they were screening to ensure no organ damage was showing. The tests showed no organ damage so that was great, but because the vet noted our dog was teething at the time- the AKC insurance adjuster said THAT was the cause of the excessive drooling and declined payment. Great way to dodge payment since Ortho issues are not covered. The issue resolved in 48 hours, but the dog was still teething so that was not the cause of the drooling.
We also had the wellness plan for our cats- it has been a month since I submitted the claim for that and still no completion. It is unfortunate that they are so under-staffed that claims take a month to review, and set the customer up for an even longer reimbursement process if/when they want more documents from your vet. I know we have begun looking at other options. Financially, it doesn’t make sense to pay thousands in premiums to have $177 bill declined for payment. 

Original post: So we have been with AKC Pet Insurance for approximately 4 years now, and I honestly could have made a commercial for them. Unfortunately my last claims experience was a bit unsettling. We had a $177 claim that was reimbursed $0. The explanation of benefits said that they did not cover my dog’s diagnosis- but that is alarming as it was an emergent visit. Specifically, our dog began drooling EXCESSIVELY.... I am used to slobber as I favor wrinkly pups, but our puppy was soaking through a full sized towel while trying to sleep, and the drool was pouring out of his mouth when he stood- his neck, chest and paws were soaked. The vet said to bring him in because she feared dehydration could set in, and that perhaps it was some chemical exposure so they wanted to run tests! We got him in, and the tests run indicated that his organs were all functioning properly, and there was no known cause for the excess drooling. They told us to watch him over the weekend and if it continued more tests would be run to check for salivary gland issues. Thankfully it subsided, but the insurance paid nothing on the claim because the only thing the vet could positively note was that he was “shedding” multiple teeth. There was no conclusive diagnosis as to what caused the drooling, so they paid nothing. My concern is that it seems they would encourage owners to wait to seek treatment unless there is some certainty of what is causing a symptom! That is no way to care for a pet! I am shocked at the philosophy so I cannot recommend the product any more. I can say that if you are considering pet insurance, you may want to ask if testing is covered even if results are negative and cannot confirm an immediate diagnosis.",1,Disillusioned Former Fan,1,,2020-11-13T15:54:46.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.akcpetinsurance.com?page=8

He spoke with the Vet on the phone to get all of the needed information since it was not being clearly communicated via fax and email. It took some work but I am thankful that the manager was able to resolve my issues. 

Previous Review: I am not sure where or how to being but dealing with AKC Pet insurance is an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE. It is stressful and time consuming. The customer service team is not knowledgeable and never have any information to share other then what is on my claims page on the website. I can read so I am not quite certain what the point is of having a customer service phone number unless it is strictly for people that cannot access their account information online. Every time a claim is rejected I get a sentence description of why it was not covered. The documents that are submitted with the claims are not thoroughly reviewed and it seems like they claims adjusters will do anything out of paying a claim if it is over a certain amount. I have been waiting over 1 1/2 months for a claim to be reviewed. When I called I was told it was because they waited 3 weeks to hear back from my vet. Which in fact is not my vet but an emergency vet that I have used in emergency situations although not in this one. This is the vet that diagnosed the previous claim that I had submitted. I understand wanting to get all of the information but I believe if they would have reached out to me to let me know that they were having trouble getting in contact with my vet I could have assisted instead they wait for me to call them to inquire to tell me this. Also, have they reached out to my vet? I have no idea. I was told I will get a call back from the manager later today or tomorrow. Please note that I have spoken to this manager on numerous occasions and also have been promised a call back from him more then once. It has been a month since I was supposed to receive my last call. This is ridiculous and a horrible way to do business. I actually believed that AKC Pet Insurance would be a reputable brand since they are associated with the AKC and recommended by them but I have been sadly mistaken. I asked who I should reach out to if I do not get what I need from the manager and I was told there was no one else. I know how businesses work. I let the customer rep know that I know that he has a manager and was told that she does not deal with customers. This is such a joke. And unfortunately the joke is on me. I guess the only route to go is to reach out to the Texas Department of Insurance and deal with them directly since I have tried working with AKC Pet Insurance directly and all I get is to be told I will get a call back.",3,My Experience is getting better,1,,2020-01-30T17:33:09.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.akcpetinsurance.com?page=9

5e30a8f73c93ae04c0d58451,False,False,"We purchased our two standard poodles, Max and Clifford, from a AKC registered breeder when they were three months old.  Upon registering them with AKC I was offered AKC pet insurance for a one month trial, which I accepted.  When the time was about to expire my husband and I decided to continue with the insurance for both of the boys.  Of course, you never know how the results of this kind of insurance will be until you have to use it, but since it was AKC we took a chance, hoping we would never have to use it.
Kind of like using your seat belt, you hope you never need it, but you use it anyway.

On December 16, 2019, my one year old standard poodle, Clifford, started acting strange.  The next morning when he went out to go potty I noticed his urine was red.  I immediately took him to our family vet and was told hours later that Clifford's RBC was at 11 and his bilirubin was 94, he was given prednisone and I was told to watch him and that he might need a transfusion.  The next morning his urine was bright red and thick.  I called the vet and told her I wanted Clifford to have a transfusion right away.  I was directed to West Vet Emergency Hospital.  Clifford was not well at all.  The doctor came out and explained what was going on with Clifford and that it would cost between $3,500 and $4,000.  We were able to say YES because we knew we had the insurance but couldn't remember all of the details.  This estimate turned out to be VERY low and in fact reached over $12,000, and that he would be on some very expensive meds for some time, including Predisone, Plavix and Cyclosporine.

Clifford was in ICU at the hospital for 12 nights, during which time he had sonograms, exrays, nasal feeding tube and intravenous tubes in three legs, and many blood transfusions.  He had been diagnosed with AMHA, an immunity disorder without any direct 
known causes.  Visiting Clifford every day was hard because he couldn't even stand up.  Seeing him on Christmas night, he finally did stand, but still was not eating.

I cannot possibly tell anyone what a relief and blessing it was, Thanks to AKC Pet Insurance, to be able to tell the hospital to do whatever was necessary and provide all Clifford needed because all we wanted was to take our boy home.

When we were finally able to take Clifford home we were told that no one expected that Clifford would ever leave the hospital and that most people would never be able to shoulder the expense of such and intensive and long treatment.

Today is January 28, 2020 and Clifford is home and doing much better but is needed blood tests every two weeks to monitor his progress and is still on all the medications.  

With some wariness I submitted the vet bill.  I was never called, emailed or questioned by AKC Pet Insurance, but within two weeks of Clifford returning home there was a check in the mail from AKC!
They have continued to promptly respond and reimburse for all of Clifford's follow up visits, blood tests and medications without question!

Again, what a true blessing to be able to care for our furbaby without the added anxiety of whether we are able to afford for his care and recovery, or having to make the horrible decision that would come with the inability to pay for his care.

I have strongly encouraged all pet owners I know to make this small investment in their pets.  Our dogs are an integral part of our family and we want to treat them as such.    I would also encourage people to take a very hard look at AKC Pet Insurance and their coverage options and prices.  I received an advertisement in my email just yesterday and looked at it.  It worked out to be twice as much as AKC, but with a $200 deductible instead of $100, with a max of $30,000 annual.  

Many thanks and kudos to AKC Pet Insurance for their incredible customer service and reliability and giving our family the opportunity to be able to afford saving the life of our sweet Clifford!",5,We purchased our two standard poodles,0,,2020-01-28T21:34:47.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.akcpetinsurance.com?page=9

5cd5d846a843690a7cd14a45,False,False,"AKC PET INSURANCE policyholder for LIFE! I had AKC insurance on my Golden Retriever, Henley, his entire life (almost 14 years). During his life, the people at AKC pet insurance were there for both of us whenever we needed them. After Henley's passing in mid-April of 2019, the team at AKC were there for ME. When I called to inform them of his passing, the representative I spoke to, ""Amy"" was so helpful and compassionate. While I was thanking her and the company for there many, many years of OUTSTANDING service, I began to get emotional. I asked her to please tell all of the other people in her office how much I appreciated them. Well, just yesterday in the mail, I received a Hallmark sympathy card signed by at least 20 employees at AKC! This gesture was so far beyond anything that I had ever expected from anybody, much less my insurance company. However, they did not stop there; also included in the envelope was a letter from John W. the President of AKC Pet Insurance thanking me for my many years of being a policyholder. He informed me that AKC had made a donation in Henley's name to a non-profit program that researches diseases in dogs and relies on grants to operate. I was so unbelievably touched by his thoughtfulness; it feels amazing to know that a donation in Henley's name will help aid in research being conducted for all of our fur babies! AKC Pet Insurance company is the BEST company I have EVER done business with. They have gained a client for life. As long as I have a dog(s) in my life, I will be sure to have AKC Pet Insurance on them...hopefully, that will be many years to come since I am only in my 40s. I simply can not thank everyone at AKC Pet Insurance enough. You ALL have touched my heart.

The 10 1/2-year-old has been sick, pretty bad the past year and they have always been very speedy when reimbursing me. The customer service representatives are very knowledgeable and also very friendly, because I’ve been using them for so many years they are basically like a family not just an insurance company.  I’ve heard some of the reviews and I’ve heard people complaining about the price of the premiums however, I reside on the East Coast and the fees here for veterinary care are astronomical.   I have one of the best plans that they offer and I feel that the reimbursement is good for what I pay per month for both dogs. As they’ve gotten older the premiums have gone up a tiny bit but so has medical care for the dogs. I think a lot of the reviews stating that they are not getting back enough money is because they don’t have the more elaborate plan. The only thing I wish is that I wish AKC would pay for alternative therapies because many of the treatments that I take my older dog to right now are holistic treatments, And these are not covered. Other than that I really don’t have any complaints they have been extremely nice to me because I have to tell you I’ve been submitting at least one claim a week on my oldest dog.

Unfortunately, I’ve been incredibly busy so I haven’t had time to connect. That’s my fault, not theirs. They told me my original comment about the deductible was incorrect & that they only charge one. My comment was based off what one of their customer service people said. Granted, I know sometimes you have a new person that may have misspoke. I’m currently trying to gather the last year’s worth of invoices to double check there weren’t errors, but I believe them if they say that I only paid 1 annual deductible. It was probably a misunderstanding. With that said, I still have 1 outstanding invoice that they may need more information on. I don’t know though because I haven’t heard anything. So, I wish that they would reach out to the customer at the same time they reach out to the vet so we can help facilitate it or at least know what’s happening.

Regardless, PetPartners is still by far the best pet insurance out there. As I said, they respond quickly and 98% of the time, reimbursement is super quick. Are there things they can do better? Yes. But that is what these surveys are for: to help them improve. Also, name 1 company who doesn’t need to improve in at least 1 thing. You can’t go wrong with PetPartners and you will deal with FAR less headaches and issues with them! Highly recommend.

********Original Review
PetPartners is very fast with processing claims. The only issues I have are: 1) if they need additional info, they don’t tell you. It was only after I checked the status of a claim after a month that I learned they needed more info. They didn’t call, email, or snail mail me; and 2) their deductible system is misleading & not something I agree with. PetPartners allows you to add packages to your base insurance for more coverage, but then you have to meet a separate deductible for each package. For example, I have the base plus 2 packages & had to meet the $250 deductible on each package essentially requiring a $750 deductible. It should be 1 deductible for all coverage. 

Aside from those 2 issues, PetPartners is great pet insurance & easy to work with. There is never any hassle.

I would like to see them offer a planned service where if you know your pet needs surgery or something and you can’t afford to pay all of it, that you can submit to them beforehand and they can send payment to the vet or a promise to pay so that the vet can bill you and go ahead with the procedure. That would set them apart from all other pet insurance!",4,PetPartners is very fast with reimbursements,0,,2019-01-24T14:52:11.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.akcpetinsurance.com?page=23

The only reason I do not give it 5/5 stars is because they have, a few times, changed their plans and policies without a heads up.  This year they changed the plans again, and did not tell us about 1 week after our renewal date.  Whereas this isn't a huge deal if you don't need to change your plan, but if you did, this would effect you.  They should reach out well before your renewal date about any changes.

My puppy has had quite a few incidents already and the AKC pet insurance has been an extremely wise investment and has covered all my expenses with my local vet once I met my deductible. The only draw back is it does take a little while before you receive your reimbursement check once you submit your paperwork along along with the insurance claim form.  The only other minor item I would comment on is to make sure your vet writes a diagnosis for anything done as symptoms won’t suffice in the insurance claim form .

It was my belief then, that the full insurance would be in effect from the day I paid for it.  I was shocked - and frankly rather disappointed - to learn that regardless of when payment is made, the trial period is forced on you.
In spite of having paid the full premium, there were certain services that were not covered because the policy was still ""in trial period.""  I just thought and still feel that is wrong.

Having said that, the coverage since then has been very good. I was very concerned as to how this most recent claim was going to be handled.  Long story short, while away from home, my 11 month old female Berner developed pyometra.  The resolution for pyometra  is spaying. The entire bill was pretty high, due to the nature of it being an emergency and there is a fixed benefit for spaying.  I was worried that the insurance would only reimburse for that fixed amount and not recognize that this wasn't a routine procedure.  I was very relieved when I received the check that it was handled appropriately.

The only other thing I would add is that the world is electronic these days, and funds should be able to be ach deposited and not require a hard check be written and mailed.",4,Overall Happy but careful of the forced trial period,0,,2018-11-19T15:54:15.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.akcpetinsurance.com?page=26

Also, nearly every time I have filed a claim, there have been exceptions, loopholes, or disclaimers that have prevented me from being reimbursed any amount that would make it worthwhile to maintain this insurance policy.  I'm particularly upset by the last claim, because I deliberately bought the extended policy that covered dental cleanings, and they used a loophole to only pay $40 rather than the $350 that the cleaning actually cost.

Also, due to the fact they still issue checks which have to be mailed vice direct deposited into my account which would save everyone time not to mention money.

Not until I needed it to cover a surgical expense was I told the bottom line of the coverage and all the “uncovered” specifics. Also I was never told that the premiums would increase with the age of the pet. They have requested copies of my pets files from the vet and she’s has written numerous letters to obtain coverage of services or prescriptions.  It very annoying and time consuming for the vet.  The customer service people are always very nice but I would never again purchase an insurance plan from Pet Partners.  It is the integrity of the corporation that I have a problem with.

Since some changes were made (ownership?), I have to spend more time, than I think is necessary, monitoring my claims/reimbursements.  Serious monetary errors have occurred .  Corrections were made, but only because of an audit or a very dedicated claims representative.  (Either way, most appreciated.) 

I think increases in pet insurance should be based on the number of MAJOR claims, not the usual health problems due to age.

I find that AKC Pet Insurance is trying to nickel and dime me with nearly every claim that I submit. But I haven't had much luck with any other pet insurers, so I suppose it is what it is. I pay extra for the wellness/preventative benefits, but they all cap at a ridiculously low amount ($50 annually for heartworm prevention? that every dog needs MONTHLY? yeah, okay). I also had a serious issue where ALL of my claims were being denied due to an ENTIRELY UNRELATED pre-existing condition. Finally, with a lot of patience (and help from my vet), we were able to get that situation sorted out.

To cut the long story short, I made a PDF for 14 or 15 reviews for the American Kennel Club and they were all 5-star except for one 2-star or 3-star. And that shows the consistency of their professional job and the seriousness and the quality of what they look after each of the reviews. That made my faith stronger. Spending my money is not the problem, the point is you want to get quality and not quantity treatment.

I went to AKC website and had checked all the coverage and compared it with them. It was neck to neck. But in terms of claims processing, Nationwide sucks big time, based on all the negative reviews. And then AKC was literally way too ahead in the game plan based on the ConsumerAffairs review. That's where I made my decision and I just went there and bought it.

I got a call right away and was impressed with their representatives. So far I only had two claims as part of the wellness exam and it includes the GRDR test and then the vaccination. The people at AKC know what they’re doing. They’re very sweet, professional, on the line, and on top of that, they’re very precise and concise to the point. They will tell exactly what you’re looking for. No plus or minus. And I knew that I was in safe hands.

I like the policy and it should help a lot if I ever do have to use it. What I don't like is the online experience. Customers should be able to create a secure online account to manage the policy, payment, and claims. My schedule makes it hard for me to make calls during business hours, so I don't like that I either have to call a representative or send personal information through email to make any sort of change to my billing. Also it would be easier for me to make sure I have the coverage I want if I could look at quotes online rather than have a representative explain them over the phone, and if I were to file a claim I'd rather submit it through a secure online profile than through mail, email, or fax. That said I have had a good experience when I have had to contact customer service for billing/quote related matters, but it would have been a lot more convenient if I didn't have to call them in the first place.",3,"It's good, online experience could be better",0,,2018-01-24T17:33:34.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.akcpetinsurance.com?page=42
