6602e6d3f0d276f02174c0a6,False,False,Fetch took over or merged with the prior insurer. We researched about how the premiums would be as the dog aged before purchasing. Sine the takeover by Fetch the premiums are out of control. They have about tripled over the past 3 years from around 388 a year to 1300 a year for 10K in coverage with no claims (2years). The old company did not substantially raise the premiums as the dog aged. I would say to run for the hills when considering Fetch.   I would not recommend this company to anyone because of their gotcha pricing as the dog gets older as opposed to the prior company that they took over PetPlan around 2019 and we are completely dissatisfied.,1,Stay away-Not the old Petplan insurance that they took over,1,2024-03-26T00:00:00.000Z,2024-03-26T17:16:36.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/fetchpet.com?page=3

I don't know what percent of their policy that is, but I was raised 38% this year and last year it was close to 40%. I have had to make changes in the coverages to make it affordable. I read a review here suggesting saving your money and paying the bills as you go along. That is a great idea!  I wish I had done a very long time ago. It makes a lot of sense. If you are good with budgeting, it makes sense because pet insurance is not a good investment. I've spent tens of thousands of money on this pet insurance. If I had saved the money and paid the costs from my bank account, I would now have at least $15k extra in the bank. (I did the math.) I am tempted to wing it and pay as I go along. I could afford it decades ago for a dog who lived to 16 and I had no pet insurance back then, and I wasn't making a lot of money. I survived financially. This insurance for 2 dogs costs me annually more than 3 vehicles with full coverage and zero claims on my auto policy. I can put the money into a CD. They do process claims in a timely manner, but they charge $3.50 per pet per transaction each time they charge for the policy payment. (That's 2 transactions for me per quarter for my 2 dogs, $28 a year.) Other companies are charging $2 for one transaction because they combine the policies in one single charge. The fee equates to less for me to be billed monthly somewhere else than to be billed quarterly with Fetch. Not for nothing, but why would Fetch's charges be so much higher when their employees have been working from home since at least covid? There is barely any overhead. They don't have to rent or buy and office building, pay for heat and A/C, pay cleaning people, etc. What constitutes their fees and exorbitant increases? Come on. I do have to credit Katie for correcting misinformation I got from someone else there (Lisa) who (twice) told me the fee was $5 per dog, saying it would be $40 total to be billed quarterly and $120 total to be billed monthly. The increases have been huge for years. They changed one of my dogs to their new policy with an annual deductible and didn't change my other, yet they are the same age and were insured the same day from the start. It doesn't make sense.

65f7640b6c1f86c0d1218262,False,False,"In 2017, I became a policyholder under the provision of pet insurance for my Yorkshire Terrier, opting for the plan with unlimited coverage, a 90% reimbursement rate, and an annual deductible of $150. Year by year, I have endured an increasing premium payment, averaging an 8% increase annually straight from 2017 through 2022. Please see the detailed analysis below:
2017: $434.52
2018: $456.51 (5% increase)
2019: $519.57 (12% increase)
2020: $597.32 (13% increase)
2021: $649.12 (8% increase)
2022: $732.21 (11% increase)
2023: $1,064.28 (31% increase)
2024: $1,775.92 (40% increase)
The subsequent years showed an alarming increase after Petplan attempted to modify my coverage in 2022. A proposed restriction on my annual cover to $5K was introduced, coupled with a reduced reimbursement rate of 80% and an increased deductible of $500.
I called in to discuss my plan on 02/01/24 at 12:39 PM and spoke with Jordan. His tone and manner were cold, callous, and very condescending. He talked down to me and made me feel bad for choosing to provide my pet with the highest level of coverage from the beginning. He offered unreasonable downgrades and suggested I cancel my service. Refusing such alterations, I faced an undeserved punishment of increasing rates by 30% and 40% in the years 2023 and 2024, respectively. Essentially, feeling strong-armed into reducing my coverage or canceling my policy. 
According to the ""Healthy Paws Cost of Pet Care Report"" by Canine Journal, the average annual cost of pet insurance in New Jersey for a dog with unlimited coverage is $672. When compared with the $1775.92 price tag Petplan has levied upon me, this constitutes a 59% increase, which is preposterous. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has regulations in place requiring insurance companies to publicly explain any rate increase of 15% or more before its implementation, which Petplan is unable to do.
I do not have a history of filing claims. My pet has all his annual check-ups, necessary vaccinations, and preventative care, and raising my rates this high with no just cause appears deceptive. PetPlan is not basing my rates on the actual cost of insurance in NJ, my car, homeowners and medical insurance did not increase by 59% over the 2 years. Petplan's inability to provide a reasonable justification for this egregious 59% rate increase is an unethical practice of price gouging.

It's good customer service.

There was some confusion over how my bills were being handled.
In the end it worked out well.
It was a lot of work on my end.
More time is needed to tell if it will be a good fit for me. 
I recently had to put my 15 yr old dog down and she did have some health issues..I visited a rescue and after meeting a puppy of 3 months I decided to Adopt.
Amanda M. spoke about the insurance, had a pamphlet, mentioned their would be a discount given if I purchased it as well as a portion that went to the facility.
I didn't sign up right there.
I had 24 hours to decide.
I could add to a wellness package, change my deductible, etc.
Puppies need several wellness visits and many vaccines. So that part isn't great.
Example two Lyme boosters, two DHPP, two DHLPP, two Lyme, two Canine influenza and so on. 
Your payout is very limited that first year if you have a puppy 
The illness/ Injury package doesn't go into effect right away. You have to meet your deductible first.

You can cancel at anytime.
What I hope is that I at least get my monthly payout back by turning in receipts.
All of these visits are expensive and in top your paying for insurance as well.
The cap on wellness is $500 a year.

It's great if you take your dog once for a wellness with vaccinations, Heart guard/ flea and tick, urine, heartworm test etc.

Feb 16 said claim was in review 

Feb 19 received email from Fetch wanting all information from VCA medical records ,for what reason ? they were not the vet who put her down. I had already submitted the medical notes with invoice the day she passed away from my vet.
 
I called them on Feb 19 was shocked why they needed notes from VCA spoke with Johnny and he said he would take care of calling VCA for me,. What does VCA have to do with this ? it was my other vet who had put Bella my dog down and I had already sent in the medical notes plus details on Feb 6 as it was. 

Feb 28,received email from Fetch saying they do not have any information yet from me .. I then had  VCA re send me all 39 pages of medical notes from her seizures and situation.

I tried uploading it again and it said I could not submit it,I then called fetch again on Feb 28 and they said they had received everything again on Feb 21 and how things are now resolved, 

March 13,received email from fetch how my claim was approved but I have not met the deductible. 
I had enough of the drama and emailed Johnny and told him again what happened and he again cancelled my account again for the 2nd time.

After everything I had been through with the loss of my dog Bella,I am heart broken and devastated and traumatised by what happened as she only just turned 3 and then having to deal with Fetch insurance and sending them in over 39 pages on her medical conditions just for her Euthanasia !! when VCA had nothing to do with the euthanasia ,I was shocked by how I got treated by fetch insurance and will never deal with them again. I had to continue to go through this heart breaking situation daily and shocked to why fetch would continue to put me through this.

I have had many dogs in my life and have never experienced something so insensitive as what i went through with Fetch over a claim for my dogs euthanasia on Feb 6 2024.. 

I wanted to thank Johnny as he was very kind to me. How ever ,what the claims department had put me through its not forgivable at all. They truly dont care about your animals, only getting money from you and to put you through a claim over a euthanasia of your animal then asking for information that has nothing to do with it for no reason at all then putting me through this from Feb 6 2024-until March 13 is not acceptable while I am still healing from my beloved dog who was my world ,my everything and best friend who is now gone forever. Never have I ever experienced anything like this from any other pet  insurance companies I had dealt with in the past for my animals .

Not only they do not return calls forever, but their management is useless and Rude!!! I had to “fetch” so they can review my claims. Until it was too late, and they conveniently told me the claim review period was over.  And, even then I was told the plan wouldn’t cover it. So what does it cover???? Managment of the company is ignorant to the clients. They will not help you. Even customer care person was MORE understanding than the manager. He clearly said “No” to any of my questions. For questions why their company did not return the calls he lied to me that they did and I did not pick up the phone - so why didn’t you leave a voicemail??? Isn’t it a sensible thing to do to leave a voice message with the contact so your client can call you back?! So it’s a total lie. He did not call me. He even tried to accuse me in lying when I said that I called them multiple times to find out what’s going on with my claims. He told me how they do not accept it over the phone - so he has no clue about their automated system. He was HIGHLY incompetent and rude! If you love your pet DO NOT buy this so called insurance.

I did that through the app on January 15 I believe, but it did not go through and I did not notice until March 4 which happened to be my birthday, I noticed that there was actually two charges on there so I called Fetch and explained to them that this was supposed to have been canceled that I knew I couldn’t get February back but if we could please do something about March and they did, she said that she sent a ticket to accounting so that I could get refunded for the payment that was taken on the second and on 4 March , then she sent me an email verifying that the account was closed about three hours later I received an additional debit from my account from Fetch, so I called Fetch again, and they told me that it was a glitch, and that they have never seen anything like it, and that they were going to expedite a ticket to IT , they could not, however give me an answer as to if this was definitely not going to happen again, so I called my bank and my bank stop those charges and ended up having to cancel my debit card. Issue me a new one and I had to pay to have it expedited to me within 24 to 48 hours but the very next day Fetch debited my account again apparently they’re saying it was done through a digital wallet, that I’m not sure of, but I have now been debited a total of five times, Fetch really doesn’t know what’s going on my bank of course is having to wait until the pending charges actually go through so that they can turn around and reverse the charges but here’s my thing, this all seems very illegal, because why is a company holding onto my financial information and charging me days after they verified not once, but twice that the account was closed ?

1- My pet was now in a higher rate category due to her age.

3-There was also a rate increase due to a lot of claims being made with the type of breed of dog I have.
I was so pleased that she took the time to answer the questions I had and also did not make me feel rushed so she could answer another call. 
 HERE IS ANOTHER REASON I AM PLEASED WITH FETCH AS MY PET INSURANCE COMPANY.
About 2 years ago I realized that I had incorrectly reported my dog as being a purebred when she was actually a mixed breed. Note! There is a large difference in premiums then. At least that was in my case.
So what Fetch did for me is that they refunded me the difference for that year and also for the prior years overpayment. This was so unexpected but appreciated especially since it was an error on my part. The refunds of the premiums were about $500 for each of the 2 years.

65bc1fd2b27b27ea173db583,False,False,"It's really unfortunate my pet became ill shortly after I switched insurance providers, essentially disqualifying him from all future claims. I'm mainly to blame for not reading the fine print and keeping my old policy during the waiting period (if that's allowed), but here's what I could have reasonably expected.
1. A shorter review period: It took over two weeks to hear back when the date alone should have resulted in a denial of the claim in an automated way.
2. Clearer disclosure of terms: The policy effective date isn't when policy coverage actually starts. It starts 15 days following. For joint related issues it starts 6 months following. I put in a lot of time to put the claim documentation together and didn't expect to be over 4000 dollars behind after waiting. Ideally the portal shouldn't have even let me submit. There should also be an initial option selection for joint health related claims when filing within 6 months of signup where the portal automatically denies the claim. At the very least that information should be presented in a clear way upon sign-up.

Given their response to my inquiry, any clinical symptom during the waiting period can be associated with any later health condition, disqualifying coverage. In my case, my pet having an upset stomach and potential immune condition or arthritis got grouped into a health condition that can overlap with just about anything later.

""A pre-existing condition is any medical condition which first occurred or showed clinical signs before the effective date of your policy or during the 15-day waiting period.

This means they're dirty enough to notice, but not out of the norm, and not enough of a problem to fix. Basically normal wear and tear.

The other day she chipped her tooth playing, so I took her to the vet. Fetch would not cover that visit, and would not cover the procedure the vet recommended because a chipped tooth is ""related"" to dirty teeth... 
I spoke to customer service who defended the decision to not cover the procedure because the vet wanted to clean her teeth during the procedure to have a better view. Customer service thought it was weird that Fetch wouldn't cover the visit though, so customer service resubmitted the claim. I got an email the next day informing me it was still denied.

I chose Fetch because they covered teeth. It was expensive, and the monthly cost was more than triple what they've reimbursed me for, but I figured it would come in handy if something like a chipped tooth ever happened. I underestimated their greed and apathy. Don't make the same mistake I did.

That is why I gave you an extra star.At least I am not ignored like I have been in the past when I attempted to contact Fetch through email  (eight times I emailed asking about possibility of being downgraded in 2023). Never a response back.
However; you have not answered any of my questions. Fetch is very good in deflecting their responses. So I will enumerate them .
1. Why was I told December 11th that my policies were all good by an agent  and that they would be renewed with no changes? That is why I did not decrease policies myself
2. Why was I told by Lindsay customer advocate that it wouldn't have made a difference if I downgraded myself Mischi's policy would have still been downgraded.
3. Why do pet parents have to guess if they are submitting too many claims over the years and run a risk of being downgraded?
4. Why is the formula for downgrading a secret?
5. I have spoken to several companies and Fetch is  the only company,so far  that downgrades. Why is that?
6. Never met the annual maximum yet my two policies were downgraded without notice and explanation why is that?
7. Why in the letter that was downgrading it says to call and explore  options and yet there are no options! Why is that not written in the letter with an explanation of why the policy was changed?
8. Why was an autonation's Parts supply number provided to discuss my options which means choices?
That's enough questions for now.  


Thanks for answering the auto-nations number question.   I tried several times the night I received the email and I continued to get an AutoNation' s service dept. I reported this to fetch the next day I'm glad they fixed it. As for speaking to agents yes I have spoken to 3 on the phone and have emailed infofetch and customer advocate email  for emailed  quotes and questions about having two pet insurance policies.

Fetch needs to review the competitors pricing and match up accordingly. In the last 5 years I have had this insurance, my premium went up from $300 to $1700!! This is six times the original premium and I never even had a claim in the first three years! Over the years they increased, doubled my premium, I never said anything but the most recent increase in premium went up another $700 straight away. 

$1700 annually plus tax for a $5000 coverage and 80% coverage is extremely low and unacceptable. Other insurance companies cover $10,000 to $20,000 for ~$1200 premium for the same dog.
Almost feels like a rip off at this point because they think you cant move. When you call the customer service to talk about the premium, they have an attitude so its pointless. There is no solution outside of just cancelling or continuing to pay really.

65a70cea8cd1c56299c9c256,False,False,"The worse pet insurance ever. I signed up for insurance for my cat when she was 15 because she was healthy and I just adopted another cat from APL who suggested I try fetch pet insurance. I thought if APL is recommending it maybe it’s good. Huge mistake. I should have researched it first. They claim they take care of claims within 2 weeks. Big lie. They take easily 3-4 weeks then always claim they need more info. You send the info again and it takes another 2-3 weeks. Then I was denied for a claim. My cat went to a specialist that was recommended by oncology . She had a colonoscopy with biopsy that showed small cell lymphoma of intestines. I was denied the claim bc fetch claimed my cat had prior weight loss which was incorrect. All of her exams that clearly had the weight stated was over 10 pounds until Oct 30, 2023 when it showed over 8 pounds. This was a NEW weight loss not discovered until well after signing on with fetch. I cancelled the insurance. It’s just to stressful dealing with them as they do anything to stall the claim and not refund you but they sure are quick to take your money when it’s due every 3 months. I don’t even think the insurance is worth it. Since my cat was older ( 15 years ) when I got this her premium was 500 every 3 months .  Then it only paid 80 percent after 400 deductible and maximum 5,000 a year. When you think about it it doesn’t really cover that much. I would be paying 2 grand a year to cover her anyways and the headache of them delaying the claims and delaying and acting like they don’t have everyhing when they do then not paying attention to the actual dr notes ( if they looked at my cats actual weight for every appointment) they would have clearly seen her weight loss was not discovered until well after the insurance kicked in.

They have also been very kind and courteous 
Understanding your policy is important so you know what you're actually responsible to pay for.
The first 6 years I didn't use it much as our cat has been pretty healthy but lately she has had some issues that required some medical attention.
Having said that there is some procedures that she needs done so it was nice to have a policy in place to help share the costs.
Pet insurance can be quite expensive but so can an emergency trip to the vet.
Pets are just like people and can have unexpected health issues at any time without warning.
Sometimes you don't think about that when you first bring your new pet home.
Fetch has been pretty good. Submit the claim form which goes in for a review and once it's completed and accepted you can have the money directly deposited into your account.
The review time process is reasonable and you get constant updates as to the status of your claim.

Their premiums have doubled since I got them insured. They were insured since almost day 1 and prices have only gone up and up and up. They don't give any discount for adding a second pet and they are not simple to deal with when submitting a claim. They will try to relate ANYTHING to a pre-existing condition. My dog had a cough as a puppy and they tried to tell me her pink eye was pre-existing from the cough over a year prior. I had to fight to get $30 eye drops covered. The app glitches often and reimbursement is slow. I have contacted them already about all of these things and their response took weeks and was basically just excuses why. Including the area I live in, just like car insurance. So no matter how well I take care of my pet, if I live somewhere they deem more hazardous, they will charge me more. Like they assume if I live in a city I'm going to let my dogs play in traffic. When I first signed up they said the premium increased in accordance with yearly vet increases. This is so NOT the case. My insurance is so much now, that it would be cheaper to just pay their bills outright at the vet. Fetch does not provide more or better service for the price increases either. I would definitely do things differently next time. If my insurance continues on this trajectory I would have been WAY better off setting monthly money aside for any illness or emergencies they may have. Insurance is not affordable for the average person. It would be nice if a company that actually cared about pets' being well being existed in Canada.

659b5e1253c21d2e35019ea1,False,False,"I have had Fetch insurance for 8 years - I truly regret that I selected this company. 
My monthly fees have skyrocketed each year (from initially being under $100 a month) and took such an extreme leap when my dog turned 6 - going up by $200 a month. 
The only explanation they could provide was that my policy had ""too much coverage"" (Ie. they don't even offer it anymore) and that at 6 years old my dog (who is a small breed who will easily live over double that) was considered to be a senior. 
I made some policy changes to bring the monthly cost down to $130 - now today I have a policy renewal email saying it's increased by $100 per month yet again. 
Do not use this company - make a choice that offers transparency when it comes to how your policy cost may be adjusted/calculated.

EDIT: Re Fetch Reply - 

At no point throughout my review did I say that Fetch has not covered claims (though there have been times when they have not, despite explanations from my vet). 
And I have spoken with representatives - one of whom candidly acknowledged that because I joined when Fetch was a new company and they no longer offer the level of coverage I initially had, the tactic of raising my monthly rate by over $100 a month at a time is to encourage me to decrease my dogs coverage and effectively force me out of the level of care I have. 
Given I have made use of my policy during some seriously unfortunate heath issues and given that my dog is only half way through his life, I can only imagine what my policy will become cost wise if it continues to be raised by $100 a month yearly as he actually becomes a senior dog.
 
While Fetch has covered many medical bills (as is the purpose of insurance) I would want to know, if I were a new pet owner looking for insurance, that there is no controlled limit to how much your policy cost can be raised it seems, and that the company would have considered my dog senior at the age of 6.

However, I would have given 1 star evaluation based on Fetch polices. 
Buyer Beware!! This means as your pet ages and your insurance will increase... For the past couple of years our insurance premium has increased by at least 20% each year! I have had my monthly payment go from $43.00 per month (pup was under a year) to her Second Birthday it was jumped to $58.00 per month! (Don't forget the $6.00 per month charge for processing for on top of that.) 

There is only 2 options to lower this monthly fee. 
1) To adjust her coverage from $10,000 annually to $2,500. Or...
2) To increase my deductible from $300 to a higher annual deductible. (Which replenishes every year at the date you started the policy.)
I chose option 1. Which means I have less coverage annually incase something does happen. 

In my option, based on what I know now, I would research other insurance company's before signing with Fetch. And now I'm waiting for the year I get the increase... I can no longer afford to keep insurance for my beloved pet....Or have so little coverage...what will be the point of it. 
Keep looking.. For the the T in True.

UPDATE in response to Fetch Pet... For the annual increases there may not be a ""set"" increase. However the percentage I gave is based on the past few years. And these Are the increases I have experienced thus far. And I would like to warn others of these facts. My father has other insurance provider for his dog and his annual increases have been under 5 dollars per month and he has been with them for over 4 years. Without adjusting his coverage!

As for the transparency you claim your company has, ""the bunch of Other options"" to lower the cost of the premium, please due tell us all. I just do not understand why I have to adjust my coverage to make up for the hike in rates. 

For anyone New to the pet insurance world. Please do your research. I want to help & inform as many as I can.

 With a $1000 claim at 70% reimbursementrate, they deducted your reimbursement rate off FIRST ( so 30% off the money we are 100% responsible for). Therefore,  making your claim $700 and they reimburse you 70% of that amount.

In 2023, they decided to introduce something they have called a ""claims surcharge"" - essentially a penalty for having used your insurance. It took months of talking to tens of customer service people to figure it out, but we ultimately found out that there are 10%, 20% and 30% penalty tiers based on how many years you have been reimbursed over $250 for. We were in the 20% camp. With a 6 year old dog, 20% of our premium in surcharge is A LOT of money - more money than we were willing to pay on top of the already-sizeable annual premium increase. We were also told that it would take 3 years of claims under $250 to be reduced to the 10% penalty camp.

I asked her to have the underwriters review the notes more clearly and she said it's impossible.  They will never review again (so human error means nothing to them).

65652ba06738c528f0f34500,False,False,"Run don't walk from this company.  I'll give you my honest 13-year experience with examples.  They were actually great for years when they were petplan, but became terrible once taken over by the Dodo (apt name).  A few examples: 1. Want to spend money on a new policy?  They're happy to take your call.  However, if you're spending thousands (and you WILL spend thousands) per year, you're stuck with a crappy chatbot that gives you incomplete and unhelpful options.  After lots of time getting nowhere you'll have to wait for an email response. No time for personal calls once you have your policy.  2. (This one I think is the most egregious, and likely tricks many customers): Your copay plan will have an actual deductible that FAR EXCEEDS the published deductible.  Example: a 70-30 plan with a $500 'per condition' deductible.  When we had expenses they would only apply 70% of those expenses to the deductible.  So you'll find that you spend far more than $500 before you hit your deductible. Simple math means, in fact, that you'll spend $715 to hit a ""$500"" deductible ($715 X 70% = $500).  Imagine - that's advertised as a $500 deductible.  Take that for each condition because the deductible is 'per condition', and you'll find that you're spending hundreds - if not thousands - more than the published deductible before you get any coverage whatsoever.  Shady.  3. At annual rollover, your premiums will definitely go up, sometimes by 200-300%.  Do they give you notice and an option to continue?  Nope - they used to (with petplan)....but now the Dodo automatically bills you at the new rate.  Want to make a change?  Cancel?  Well, you're stuck with the unhelpful chatbot yet again (which, surprise surprise, includes no 'cancellation' option).  4. Finally, when the company was still petplan we had a death benefit associated with the policy.  After experiencing the deep sadness associated with saying goodbye to our 13 yo lab, we read the fine print of the new policy, which states that no death benefits are paid to animals over age 8.  There's more, but that's enough.  It used to be a great company - now it's profit only.  You can definitely do better - shop around.
UPDATE:
Even after all of this (see reply below), and after cancelling my policy due to the death of our pet, they just charged my credit card again for > $200 for our monthly premium.

654045de126ab62236f24167,False,False,"I wish I had shopped around more and read more reviews when choosing a pet insurance company for my puppy. When I joined, this was called Pet Plan. Maybe I joined right before the transition to fetch but there was no website to use, only an app that never worked. For about a year the app didn't work. Now it seems ok but its the hugest pain to submit a claim because they don't just accept the straightforward invoice that other companies want...no, no, no, this company wants you to send the vet notes and all of the documents from all of the previous visits before they take their sweet time to process the claim. I mean the longest processing time I've ever experienced. Oh and if you're in Canada, they can figure out how to take your money directly out of your bank account, but not how to deposit it there once you finally see some money back. So they mail you a cheque in the mail!! 
Also, every single year, my premiums have gone up about $10 per month!! So if you think you're getting a deal with the initial quote, think again!! I just got my renewal letter for the coming year. The premiums are going up to over $60/month when I've been paying $45 per month; this is AFTER I halved my coverage last year because the monthly payments keep going crazy high upon renewal. 
Don't forget, with these pet insurance companies, if your puppy ever gets something like an ear infection,  good luck changing to another insurance company because that's called ""pre-existing condition"" and that will not be covered going forward.

The other thing I'd like to mention here is the fact that one day I looked into my account and could see all of the personal information of another person! Names, addresses, phone number, all pet information and history and even some payment information. I immediately contacted Fetch and they acted like this total breach of private information was no big deal! I personally contacted the person to tell them what had happened and this company didn't even tell them it had happened! I take great issue with that and so should you. 

I feel stuck using them now since my pup has had a few claims.

 I think it would be better to take the money I'm paying in premiums and put it in an account for a day I might really need it for my pup instead.

Our solace came from our neighbors Akita who lovingly always greeted us kindly and looked for her friend our beloved Oli nearly every day.  My youngest son - who had been particularly close to our dog - wanted a dog for graduation, although we were still feeling our loss his dad and I agreed.  Enter a 10-month old Akita who we renamed Kofe.  From the moment my son met him in the shelter, they had a strong bond.  Everything was going beautifully, we took Kofe everywhere our family went - until August 2023 when the dog became violently ill.  We rushed him to our family vet several times and as he continued to decline, we ended up taking him to the Vet Urgent Care who immediately referred us to The Ohio State University Vet Hospital.  He was in ICU and our son was devistated...we all were worried, would we lose the dog that was just beginning to fill the whole in our hearts?  Money put aside to make necessary house repairs had to be used for the dogs care instead. The expense was big. It was a huge relief that after a frightening week Kofe turned the corner and stabelized - finally allowing us to take him home.

 Enter Fetch Pet Insurance, although there were a couple of occasions where I wish I could of asked a question specifically to our adjuster, overall submitting the documents and receiving some recovery was a beautiful experience.  Our dog is doing well now and our vet is still following him closely. Our son has him by his side almost always.  Plus, Thanks to Fetch we were able to get our home repairs done after all.

Fetch has always paid claims with no questions asked or tried to finagle out of veterinary charges or argue a treatment wasn't necessary. The claims process is simple and easy.

I understand that this is a business, however, feeling like you are being kicked out of the ""program"" that you have remained with and that has been with you to care for your pets is not a good feeling. I can't figure out if they exponentially increase the premiums on purpose to encourage clients to drop out of the program because they find them too big a risk or if that is just their premium model but it leaves you feeling like this partner you had is basically price gouging you when you have been loyally paying premiums for years. Again, I understand it is a business and I am grateful to be able to have access to pet insurance but the premiums past age 10 or so insane that it leaves you in a gap where the premiums are so expensive and dropping the coverage would be risky because your pet isn't quite old enough where expensive care or treatment options may still be warranted.

Without insurance that would have cost us approximately $15000 for the 2.  With insurance it was around $4500.  Then recently, at age 8, after a lot of testing the vet found a lump on his thyroid that turned out to be a thyroid tumor.  $3000 for the CAT scan and another $5000 for the surgery and biopsy.  The biopsy showed it to be malignant.  Thankfully, caught early, he is recovering well. We paid $2400. We would have paid for all of this, regardless of whether we had insurance, because our dogs are our children but it sure made it easier knowing we had insurance to help cover these unexpected costs.

6530260b4275dbe0dbdf6465,False,False,"I've been a loyal customer of Fetch Pet Insurance for an astounding 14 years, and I can confidently say that their coverage is nothing short of amazing. Throughout my journey with Fetch, I've had the pleasure of experiencing their exceptional service and comprehensive coverage firsthand, making a challenging time in my life a little easier.

Fetch Pet Insurance's coverage is truly impressive. They cover virtually everything, with the exception of preexisting conditions and routine visits like vaccines. This coverage came in handy, especially during the first two years of my beloved Frenchie's life when it more than paid for itself. Knowing that I had Fetch by my side to help with unexpected medical expenses provided invaluable peace of mind.

However, what truly sets Fetch apart is their outstanding customer service, and in particular, Heather Fisher. When my Frenchie sadly passed away on September 20, 2023, I needed to make the difficult decision to cancel his insurance. Heather Fisher was there to guide me through the process with unwavering compassion and professionalism.

Heather took her time to ensure I understood every step of the process and patiently answered all my questions. She displayed a genuine understanding of the emotional difficulty of the situation and went above and beyond to provide support during a trying time. Most notably, she was able to backdate my bill and promptly reimbursed me for the month of October, something I genuinely appreciated.

Losing a pet is an incredibly emotional and challenging experience, and often, practical matters like canceling insurance can slip through the cracks as we cope with our grief. Heather's proactive assistance was a reminder that Fetch Pet Insurance genuinely cares about its customers and their pets, even during the most difficult moments.

In conclusion, Fetch Pet Insurance has been a lifeline for me and my furry family member for over a decade, providing excellent coverage and unwavering support. The compassionate service I received from Heather Fisher during my Frenchie's passing further solidified my trust in this company. I highly recommend Fetch Pet Insurance to any pet owner looking for comprehensive coverage and exceptional customer service.

652ad2e40259316561363133,False,False,"Update: Fetch reached out to me to say they indeed paid me but this was for a completely different claim.  The dental cleaning and the corresponding $100 reimbursement I was owed for subscribing to the wellness plan was indeed denied.  They denied it under the wellness plan as well as the regular insurance plan, all because my puppy needed a teeth cleaning. So if teeth are in need of a cleaning, they will not pay the $100 entitles for a cleaning. If your puppy does NOT need a cleaning then they’re happy to pay for something that does not need to be done. Makes total sense. Again, be very careful as they will make you feel safe and secure with this wellness plan but will then refuse to pay when you try and use it.  Total scam. 

This company totally violates the trust you have that they will be there if you ever need them.  I get it, an insurance company needs to make money.  Fetch was completely dishonest in the way they marketed their product.  I signed up for Fetch and the biggest reason I chose this company over all of the others is their wellness plan. I paid almost double the normal premium to include the wellness plan that gives you menu back towards things like vaccinations, heart worm medicine and, more importantly, money towards dental cleaning. My puppy had a dental cleaning scheduled for months. Her checkup before the dental cleaning had the doctor noting stage 1 periodontal disease. This is very common and highlights the need for annual cleanings. But because of the stage 1, fetch denied the claim for dental cleaning. That’s fine. Preexisting condition. Sure. But they also denied the $100 reimbursement from the wellness plan I paid for because of it. Nowhere did it EVER say that the wellness plan that you pay extra for has severe limitations and exclusions just like the regular insurance. So it makes me worry in the future what else this company will deny. You place your trust and your money in this company and they act like they want to care about your pet. But what happens when you need them the most? Will they leave you high and dry? This is all about trust and the question is can you trust this company to honor their commitment to your pet?",1,This company totally violates trust.,0,2023-10-11T00:00:00.000Z,2023-10-14T19:41:56.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/fetchpet.com?page=35

And when you don't do this, every problem your dog has, they say it's pre-existing so they don’t pay you. My dog ​​came from Brazil, without any problems because a sick dog cannot travel. He had a check up in Brazil to travel and came here in May, in August he had skin problems, and the vet thinks it is an allergy to the environment make sense he is in a new country. Fetch refused to pay for the claim because they claim it could be something pre-existing. So why don't they ask us to do a check up when we start paying the company? Now I have a big problem because if I start at another company this will be a pre-existing problem, so I need to stay on my own. When I called to close my police they told me, pay for a check up and the next things will be covered, and we ignore the problem that appears now? Do I keep paying them and the medicine? Why they didn't tell me this before a problem appeared, very mean of you. For you it’s just one more person or few dollars but for me it is stability of my family, it is not a joke. I am very upset I didn’t expect that. Thank you for causing me such a headache.

In 2023 I made my first claim for a dental procedure due to periodontal disease.  Fetch made every possible way to deny my claim.  For example, in 2020 it was during the pandemic when most vets are not taking in any annual exams only emergency cases.  My claim was denied because my dog did not get an annual exam every year despite it was during a pandemic.  They also never ask for me to submit the medical record in 2015 when I started the policy.  However, right now they are saying I am unable to provide the medical record in 2015 therefore the claim is also denied.  They are finding every excuse to deny my claim.

But the claim process requires too much information- your vet's medical notes - and is painfully slow 

Then after an eye infection we discovered Gary had allergies and it cost me $425 to find that out ! 

Fetch denied the claim. Said it was a pre-existing condition. If it was I didn't know. I love my dog so my concern was an eye infection

At $300 a year and $30 per month ? And to deny an 80% of $425 claim after a month and a half ?? 

Cancel it 

And then they blackmail you with ""now that this condition is known other pet insurance companies will penalize you "" is amateurish

65047ed0a267105d3f934579,False,False,"Unfortunately I had thought I found a great pet insurance provider with Fetch. I have been using Fetch for 3 years with our Dog. I had the highest of the insurance plans with unlimited coverage, low deductible and high reimbursement rate. I accepted Fetch's increased yearly renewal fee as I wanted to best coverage for our dog. This year when my plan was renewed they automatically dropped me into their low-end insurance plan saying we used our insurance to a level where they paid for insurance claims higher than our monthly amount so we were automatically reduced into a low-end offering and nothing we could do about it. This is completely upsetting - after all, isn't insurance supposed to be used? After speaking with 2 Fetch representatives (manager) they called attention to fine print somewhere which is their loophole to doing this unfortunate action. Fetch will penalize you for actually using their insurance. I don't recommend moving forward with choosing Fetch as your animal insurance coverage- if you ultimately end up using your insurance you will get penalized. 

As a high advocate for dogs and as someone who is very involved in national dog groups and leading my own chapter, I will be letting all my alliances and members know this is not the insurance to choose if they want best in class support.

Since getting Fetch they have not reimbursed me for a single thing. With my first dog, I understand there's a 2 weeks grace period where nothing pre-existing is covered, understandable. My dog had giardia, he was treated for it, tested NEGATIVE and giardia free for awhile. When he had a 2nd giardia infection well after the 2 weeks grace period, they declined my claims, stating it was pre-existing. I submitted a claim for my second's hair loss, they denied it saying they weren't my primary insurance and wasn't given a real reason why they weren't my primary insurance. There were no explanations in their emails. I purchased Fetch first before purchasing Trupanion, they never once told me what makes them primary or secondary. When I tried to cancel or find any kind of customer service, it was nearly impossible to get a real person. The bot offered unhelpful prompts. The phone tree sent me around and around until I tried nearly every option to get a real person. We requested cancellation email on the policies as well on the claims, they failed to deliver the latter. I've been having such a hard time filing my claims with Trupanion because I am waiting on cancelation emails/proof from Fetch. It's been months, still dealing with this.

One thing I didn't care much for is the requirement of the vet notes because the requirement is that the notes have the complete history uploaded every time a claim is made. This ends up with years worth of vet notes over the pets life time. 

It would be great if the documents for vet notes could be saved to the account to be reviewed when necessary so that only the applicable notes needed to be uploaded. The reason being that sometimes these take time to get from my vet and it really delays the payment of the claim.

Now, after my dog has gotten ill and will be denied for any other insurance company, they have lowered me to a fixed amount of coverage per year, a $500 deductible and only a 70% reimbursement rate. I’m sure they’ll tell me “you can cancel whenever you want” but now all of these things are going to be pre-existing conditions with another company and I’m left with poor coverage, when I elected to give my dog good coverage and pay for it. This is despicable treatment.

EDIT: I called, and they went beyond what I thought they would say. I was told the reason this happened is because “they were paying more in claims than they were receiving in premium payments” isn’t that the entire purpose of insurance?? Peace of mind in case this happens? You do birthday pricing that increases the premium up to 15x by the time my dog is senior, you were going to get your money back. Even if not from me, the vast majority of owners will pay significantly more in premiums than they will get in reimbursement, in case they become part of the significant minority that needs more coverage than they paid that year in premiums. That’s what you exist for. For you to slash my coverage because I needed you to do exactly what your purpose is, is beyond immoral. If people knew this is what you’d do if they ever needed you, they wouldn’t choose you for “coverage”. My recommendation to anyone reading this: choose Trupanion! They not only don’t do birthday pricing, but they will NEVER slash your coverage. Make the right decision before you end up being too late, like me.

Then they denied a sick visit and then they denied another ear infection in his right ear which was once again not a prior issue before insurance. I asked because they were not providing the services I paid for a full reimbursement of my premium of 5 months and they denied me stating that nothing I filed a claim for was covered under my policy or it was a reoccurring issue once again they clearly did not review his medical history. I then filed the complaint with the better Business bureau upon filing the complaint mid-April fetch then proceeded to go into my policy and change things that I got email alerts for to cover their own asses in a possible legal dispute they openly admitted they had an error and they adjusted the error and applied it to my deductible this is all after I canceled my policy and we were being mediated by the better Business bureau. They have denied reimbursing me my premium they have denied changing things after openly emitting they change things. This company will not pay out they will find any excuse in any reason to not cover their end of the policy they are a scam. I have fought with them since April and have gotten absolutely nowhere's they continue to deny anything and everything to do with either one covering their end of my policy or reimbursing me for my policy term.

Lucy had to wear a cone three times longer than usual because her stitches kept popping open. That’s when I enrolled them in Fetch. Later I included my 10 yr old rescue, Oreo for 438. Every three months (premium). Mocha had to go to Veterinary Emergency Group (VEG) in White Plains because she had a fever. Veg was great! They saved Mocha’s life and removed the stitches after we had a falling out with NORTH Regent Animal Hospital in Port Chester. Fetch reimbursed 80% for Mocha. When Lucy was spayed three years ago—then I didn't have Fetch—but Lucy was the reason I decided to get insurance. Oreo needed knee injections due to arthritis twice a week for three months and bloodwork. I assumed Fetch would reimburse me 80%, but they wanted more records. NRAH had blocked my number, so our new vet, Rye-Harrison Veterinarians reached out, and I received a copy. “Not Covered,” Nobody from Fetch told me that “lameness” was not covered. Please read the fine print!

Does anybody have a more humane insurance company? Should I take a chance and do without insurance?

Then why did you take my 11yr old with a high-premium if you had no plan to cover my rescue, Oreo? Give me back my money.

Fetch Pet Insurance would love to understand your experience better, so they’ve asked for more details about your review—like an order number or email.

If we don’t hear from you within 3 days, your review may be taken offline.

So, I would like to keep my review up, because I don't want anyone to get shafted like I did. I have nothing to add except the senior dog started limping after I added her to the fetch account. But Fetch said they weren't enough for ""soap notes"" from our previous vet who botched two spayings of our younger pups; one almost died. North Regent Animal Hospital kept testing our 11 year old Portuguese Water Dog--an MRI for 3,000.00--total 11,000.00. Finally, the people who did the MRI recommended an Ophthalmologist said he's blind. She also said he had Sudden Acquired Retinal Atrophy Syndrome (S.A.R.D.S.)--Leo died miserably. After the first pup's  botched spaying, we got Fetch by the Dodo. So when the second pup, Mocha was spayed and became septic, (VEG in White Plains, NY) saved her life; that's when we stopped going to North Regent Animal Hospital and began using Rye Harrison Vet (whom I love).  Fetch paid 80% after my deductible. I was very happy with Fetch and decided the larger premium for my senior rescue, Oreo would be worth it. We brought her to Rye-Harrison Vet after a few days of limping. She received Adequan Shots in her back knees twice weekly (and now once monthly).

This is beyond nonsensical given dogs get diarrhea for multiple reasons from something small as changing their food to them eating something they should not have or in my case he contracted a parasite. 

When I reached out to customer support, they kept reiterating their policy and would refuse to acknowledge we are discussed Giardia, not diarrhea. 

Their suggestion was for me to get more documentation for a reassessment.  They already have all of my pet's medical records since the day I adopted him.  They couldn't tell me what additional information to provide when I asked for some guidance.

I took them in for their annual wellness check which included vaccinations. They both had severe adverse reactions within 24 hours. Having Fetch insurance gave me peace of mind to not delay getting them in asap which actually ended up being a critical decision to admit them for on demand care. Gracie being only 10lbs had a fever of 105, was on the verge of heat stroke. Grayson at 13lbs was 103. They needed IVs plus other injections to combat the injections and additional side effects like severe diarrhea and vomiting. If I had been concerned about cost I might of waited another 24 hours to see if they would have pulled through it as the vet had told me they would be a bit off for a day or two. The annual exam/shots followed by immediate critical care quickly ballooned to $1k. After submitting my claims I was reimbursed 80% via direct deposit in about 10 days. Fetch is very good about contacting the vet directly for SOAP notes, etc.

I recommend putting that $1.2k in a savings account yearly to cover your own pets issues as you see fit. Say your pet has $4k vet bill when they are 2 years old. You would have already paid $2.4K towards achieving the insurance requirements. Then they cover 80 percent of that. You are now paying at least $800 of that vet bill.

6474dd81153122a1364e7b50,False,False,"DON'T USE FETCHPET. They are the absolute worst. Firstly, they are nearly impossible to speak with. Their chatapp...AI, not a person capable of navigating any actual issue. Their phone line? It will hang up on you at almost every turn with automated responses (that are not up to date with your account). Be prepared to call back 3-5 times before you figure out which selections might actually get you to a person. And, by the way, you might only be able to leave a VM even if you do find the right selection. Most importantly, be prepared to have a difficult-to-navigate process from start to finish. Over the last half year I have submitted over $4k of valid claims and, despite having their highest level of coverage, only received less than $800 with no explanation of why. Before FetchPet took over Petplan, it was perfectly easy to see what was accepted, rejected, and in process. Now, whether on their app or website, it's nearly impossible to tell what's been reimbursed, what hasn't, and how to rectify it so your plan can actually be put to proper use. I have spent literal months navigating their 'customer service' to have a single check resent to the correct address (yet to be done), to have claims properly processed following a car accident that left me unable to do so until after their standard submittal time (it was agonizing and lengthy to provide them with all the information they required), and to now continue to follow up on why only 20% of my claims have resulted in received reimbursement. They clearly do not want it to be simple or easy to receive what you are owed.

6470dd881dbd017eac6e7c17,False,False,"Fetch has been really great with handling the claims for my cat Harvey who became really ill with Pancreatitis and has had to also have several visits after a stay at the veterinary hospital.  I have had the insurance since 2017 and had never had to file any claims until recently.  However, when I did file the claims, they were processed promptly and with no real issues other than wanting records clear back to 2018 (so they had a complete medical history which is reasonable).  My rates are going up by almost 39% for the renewal which is find kind of steep even with a higher deductible.  On the other hand, my cat is a senior cat and the insurance has paid for itself with vet bills for my cat's recent illness.  Word of advice -- make sure that you have your pet examined by the vet for an annual check up each year -- not just when sick or have an injury.  If not, it is likely that claims will not be paid if they do not have records of the most recent examination.  Seems that some people are confused, surprised, and even angry about this when they sign up and get upset when they will not pay.  However, it is outlined in the policy documents (which should be read carefully -- especially related to pre-exisiting conditions).  If this is done, they are great about paying your claims with the exception of prescription food/pill pockets, nail trims, wellness exams/vaccinations, etc.  This type of insurance is primarily for major illnesses when vet bills can climb from hundreds to thousands of dollars in a matter of days if your pet becomes unexpectedly ill or injured.  It really helps to get some money back after a stressful situation and is a relief that you can get the proper care for your pet without having to choose between your finances or the wellbeing/life of the pet that you love. It would be nice if pet insurance would offer paying vets directly after your deductible is met similar to human insurance -- rather than paying it all up front yourself.",5,Fetch has been great,1,2023-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,2023-05-26T18:25:44.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/fetchpet.com?page=59

644ed5c8f72cacd61e75b0da,False,False,"They have paid all claims. Support and sales are polite and well educated. If you are okay with the cost of dog health insurance, then this is a good company to go with. I did some digging, and the cost is similar across different insurance companies when you compare apples to apples. The one thing to keep in mind, and this is across all companies, is that whatever conditions were treated under one policy will become pre-conditions with a different underwriter. So effectively you are choosing an insurer for the duration as the other companies will not provide coverage for anything related to past claims which took place under a different one. Another lesser-known fact is that once you decrease the level of coverage you cannot increase it.  So if you have unlimited 90% refund and change it to 10K 80%, you will not be able to go back. Additionally, premiums rise with veterinary costs and with the age of your pet. I'm told it is based on breed, dog's age, geographic area, and claims in that area (not the history of your particular dog). Fetch has discounts if you have no claims in the previous year, or in the previous 2 years. The discount is substantial. All companies, as far as I can tell are about the same regarding these things.

6443f66071898294469ea989,False,False,"I have had my dog, Iggy insured with health insurance with Pet Plan/ Fetch by the Dodo for over 10 years. I had never filed a claim until last year. My premium started at around $200.00 ( year 1) to now $1300.00, which is to be expected because of Iggy' age. I purchased it with a $450.00 Deductible at with a 20% co insurance. I sent the proper information to them and they agreed to pay. Recently I made a new claim for an ER visit for a Paw issue. My 13 1/2 year old Labradoodle could not walk.The Vet visit went well.  The bill was for $596.63, the agreed to pay $27.30. PLEASE BE AWARE OF HOW THEY COMPUTE HOW THEY PAY A CLAIM. The 20% Co pay is on the whole amount EVEN the amount of the deductible (in my case $450.00), the funds they would never pay in the first place. They are considering that deductible amount in the final payment. Like as if they paid from it. MOST human health insurance policies pay at a full reimbursement rate in my case $450.00 AFTER the deductible.
    Claim amt:                 $596.63
    Deductible:                $450.00
     Total:                         $146.63
  80% reimbursement     $117.31

$117.31 vs. $27.30
Now if Iggy has to go back for the same issue they will pay on all new dollars spent @ 80%. Just be aware on small claims they go out of their way to pay smaller. They are a Closely owned private company. They could change this easily. 
This insurance will serve you on the larger claims.

63f92f919b64b1bdaf61f7af,False,False,"This stuff is a scam. I first insured my dog with Fetch 3 years ago. He was 6 at the time, and in very healthy shape. He went for his annual every year, and had had no major issues. But, as he is 9 now, and age is catching up to him, we've had some issues crop up since becoming insured. I was under the impression that my dog would be covered for these issues, however, the representatives at this company are clearly instructed to find any even slight indication in veterinary records to deny your claim. In three years, I have paid thousands of dollars to this company in 'coverage', but I have not received a penny in benefits, as they will hack up your bill to the point where they only cover $11 of a multi hundred dollar bill, and therefore, you can never meet your deductible $500 in order to receive benefits. They will find any little thing in your pet's entire vet record to hack away at those benefits to ensure you receive nothing. I just input my latest claim today and I am looking forward, because it's just laughable now, to receiving the denial email that explains that of my $440 claim only $10 was covered so that's just $10 of my $500 deductible teehheeheee. They'll never pay you anything. Go somewhere else - trust me. I have no idea how this company has generated so many good reviews, but it may have been from before it was acquired by ""the dodo"", because I will say the assistance was better in the first few months of coverage and their agents were friendly. Now their agents just sound annoyed with questions, eager to tell you cheerily all about how they denied your claim and why (bs reasons). This company has not paid out any claim in three years. I would have been better off taking the monthly cost and putting it in a savings acct that I controlled, instead, I just paid an extra couple of grand to some greedy middle man so that they could act dodgy, no oversight, deny everything by only covering chump change on each bill, and offer no other assistance.

Their website's description of what documents are needed for a claim is misleading to say the least.

They say on their website that the medical records they need are ""Detailed medical records, including from your pet’s most recent checkup (a vet visit unrelated to your pet getting sick or hurt)"". (Trustpilot doesn't allow me to post link, but the specific webpage is titled ""Your guide to filing claims."")

But in reality, they also ask for the records from the visit which the claim is for, i.e. the visit that happened exactly because my pet was sick. And their customer service agent explicitly confirmed this to me, without explaining why it works differently than what their website says.

If they were clear and consistent upfront, I probably would have no problem with providing the medical records for every visit.

63ded0a49b64b1bdaf4d3b4d,False,False,"I had just signed up for Fetch insurance and today was the day the ""policy waiting period"" ended. I had read through the policy terms & conditions multiple times before enrolling, and then again today before I reached out to customer service for further clarification. I simply wanted to know if my pup would be covered against future diseases where vaccinations were available for those diseases, but not required. 

Anyone who has a dog knows that there are ""core vaccinations"" (DHPP) that your dog receives annually, but I was questioning if the optional vaccinations (lyme, lepto, bordetella, etc.,) were required to ensure future coverage against those diseases. 

I reached out to Fetch via live chat and a customer service rep named Rushti had a very difficult time giving me a straight answer. I had to repeat my questions multiple times before he understood what I was asking, and every answer he gave me seemed like it was copied and pasted from the policy terms & conditions. His responses were general, extremely vague and not at all helpful. I was trying to ensure that we followed their policy and covered all our bases, to make the most out of our insurance. 

I still don't understand if the optional vaccinations are required to ensure future coverage for the related diseases. I was worried that if, for example, I didn't get my pup the lyme vaccination and he was exposed to and diagnosed with lyme disease in the future, that he would not be covered because he did not receive the lyme vaccination. My pup is on flea and tick medication but I didn't know if that would suffice, and neither did Rushti. He kept reiterating that ""as long as it's not a pre-existing condition, Lyme disease is covered"" and to ""file a claim and let the claim adjuster confirm my coverage"" but that didn't answer my original question about the optional vaccines. I also don't understand why I needed to submit a claim to confirm my coverage? Then as I was typing my response, Rushti asked if I had anymore questions and then abruptly ended our chat. That was a pathetic move and extremely unprofessional.

Overall, the customer service I experienced was awful and I would cancel my insurance policy just because of that. But I will also be cancelling it due to the fact that there are so many grey areas and not enough clarity as to what us pet parents need to do to ensure our beloved pets are 100% covered. I don't like that this was a hard question for customer service to answer, I truly thought it would be a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" type of deal. Now, I believe that if I had to reach out to Fetch for their help, they would be unable to help me. They would for sure reiterate their policy but not elaborate in detail, and that's just plain wrong.

We did a lot of research and settled on Fetch. We currently have 4 cats (including our new kitten) and we just adopted a rescue dog. Our kitten is super active and even after doing everything we could to kitten-proof our house he somehow managed to break his hip - we aren’t sure how but think he climbed up the outside of the stairs and fell from 12 feet up when he couldn’t turn around - I caught him doing this the day before but grabbed him before he got too high, and hadn’t yet figure out how to prevent this. I had installed netting along the inside of the stairs in fear of him slipping through the rails but didn’t account for that 2.5” overhang on the outside. So our baby cat had to have very expensive emergency vet care followed by surgery. Fetch was amazing and it only took about 2 weeks for the reimbursement to show up in my account with zero issues. We had used it once previously for one of our cats having nonspecific gastro issues and they were just as responsive then. I can’t believe we went so many years without pet insurance but I would not be without it again.

63a72cf94d0773066a244c1d,False,False,"Fetch is a scam. They continued to charge us after we cancelled. We cancelled because the rate skyrocketed to over $2500 and the policy pays a maximum of $400 per illness. So it would be impossible to recover the premium unless my pet had 7 unrelated illnesses in one year. Absurd. We changed our credit card number to stop them from continuing to charge us and they somehow found the new number and kept charging us. We disputed the charges with our credit card company and they didn’t challenge our dispute until two years later, when they suddenly charged us for three years’ worth of insurance premiums totaling over $8k. The company changed hands (from petplan to fetch) and they claim not to have saved the recorded call during which I cancelled in 2020. So the credit card company took their side (they did not give us written confirmation of the cancellation-it was only on the call which I did not record myself) and in 2022 they made us pay $5000 for policies that were supposedly in effect for 2020 and 2021. You have 90 days to submit a claim, so there’s no way we could have derived a single penny’s worth of benefit from those premiums. Pure scam.

If anyone knows about JRTs you will understand the peace of mind insurance brings. The complaints I've read seem to be from folks who don't understand how claims are processed. Unlike people medical insurances, Fetch starts off considering 80% of the bill (the first 20% is our responsibilty to pay) then the deductible that you chose when you signed up is subtracted. After that, what's left that has been found insurable is paid to you. Direct deposit is the best! When choosing pet insurance deductibles are important to understand. I worked out the numbers for myself and here goes: a 80/20 plan with a $300 deductible will not repay you anything until you've spent over $375 but they will apply the appropriate charges to your deductible for that condition. Then if further treatment is needed for that, your deductible is met and allowable charges will be paid at 80%. With an 80/20 $500 deductible plan, you wouldn't get anything back until your bills submitted for that condition exceed $625. Submit all of your bills to apply to the deductible in case of future claims for the same condition. It's very simple. The math works out!

A little while later, we followed-up to look at enhancing our insurance plan and were told that because payments made to the previous 3 claims noted above, they cannot make any changes to our plan.

We were very surprised to hear they had made payments because...
- we have 3 letters from 'Petplan' stating each claim was denied
- no transaction record for any payment received
- BUT we have each transaction record we paid to the vet

When we asked them to clarify what payments they're referring to, they said they paid the deductible for each of the claims. Now we're really confused since who would they be paying the deductible in question to since it was not us BUT only Fetch/Petpaln.  In essence they are only paying themselves for each of the claims we made and more interestingly, recorded each deductible payment as a claim against our policy even though they denied all of them??!!!

6352b611276a7fd30bd6cac4,False,False,"The absolute worst customer service and company. Firstly the supervisor who talked to me on the phone was a horrible person, condescending and mean. 
This company will look for any ways to deny your claim reimbursement. Go for any other company than this even if it means a higher premium because you’ll be sure to receive your services, not with Fetch. 
I recently submitted TWO claims, 2 days apart for my pet Joey. They reviewed it initially and asked me for additional medical documents which I submitted. I submitted additional 9 records, his history for the prior 2 years, that’s what they asked. My pet is a 4 year old young dog who has no medical conditions and has been very healthy. Even the medical records and blood work I submitted from the first day of the claim stated he was overall very healthy but was suffering from stomach issues due to either foreign body ingestion or extreme care of gastroenteritis. 

Their 15 day thing is incorrect. I had to literally be on their chat every day to get an update just for both of my claims which are days apart to be denied. Reason: 
“ This policy does not cover:

mm. Any amount if you failed to satisfy, or comply with, the conditions set forth in the GENERAL CONDITIONS, CARE FOR YOUR PET (VII.6) section of this policy. Including, but not limited to condition b. if your pet has not been examined by a veterinarian within six (6) months prior to the effective date of the policy, you must arrange to have your pet examined at your own expense within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the policy. Any medical condition(s), clinical sign(s), behavioral disorder(s) or illness(es) observed or recorded during the first exam, and all costs associated therewith, are automatically excluded from coverage. Your failure to have a first exam of your pet may void the policy. If voided, the policy premium will be refunded. Additionally, any conditions that are related to, caused by, or resulting from medical condition(s), clinical sign(s), behavioral disorder(s) or illness(es) observed or recorded at the first exam performed after the effective date of the policy are also excluded from coverage” 

I talked to customer service and the supervisor is literally one of the worst people I’ve talked to like do you really have no heart for pet parents and I explained that one of his exams was in October 2021, a comprehensive exam from Banfield that stated he was completely healthy. They refused to take that into account because it was not exactly within the 6 month mark. I cited the policy later which clearly says that your policy needs to have 6 month prior record or an examination within 30 days or else it may be voided and your premium reimbursed. I had been paying from May- October for two pets and they never sent me any email regarding this issue and I was like my policy should have just been voided if these are your rules and why was I allowed to pay for so long without any objection from your end. 
My understanding of the whole situation is that they did this so that they can find any loophole to deny my claim, research Reddit and many customers have been so unhappy with their policies. The supervisor should firstly not even be allowed to be in a customer service role because he was the worst. They won’t reimburse my premium or approve my claim. 
I’m absolutely distraught because I trusted this dumb company and I would rather pay a higher premium than deal with this company, go with lemonade or healthy paws if you would actually like your pet to be covered and not deal with the worst customer service.

It was fairly easy to initially learn the claims submission process, and everything I sent in was immediately acknowledged and swiftly assigned to a claims examiner.  Not only were the claims processed expeditiously but by providing them with my bank information, my claims reimbursement was directly deposited into my checking account on a very timely basis.

634723129b12f67dfedf8683,False,False,"Fetch doesn’t care about you or your animal. I’m sure all insurance companies aren’t great but we’ve had this one since the day we adopted Loki. He was a 7 month old rescue and they have said literally everything is a pre- -existing condition and even though we pay every month they pay for nothing and it's been 2 years now. 

Our most recent claim was denied. It was for 2k and they said it was due to him having lupus - he had lumps all over his under belly and so the vet wanted to do a biopsy - it turned out it was a bunch of ingrown hairs due to him going into remission and all his hair growing back (really something to celebrate).

They also found out that the problem plaguing him wasn't lupus (though that's what he has) but it was an infection that had caused the lesions we'd been fighting to begin with. But none of that mattered because their only goal is to take your money and not pay anything out ever. 

They aren’t humane. They don’t call you back. They don’t work with you. It’s just a money grubbing company and the worst part is on the other end of all this is a poor, helpless dog who just needed some love and attention. If you’re going to be an insurance company for animals have a freaking heart

We'd go somewhere else but as he has a pre-existing condition (for real now, not when we was fine at 7 months old when we adopted him and go the insurance the same minute) and so it will be just as bad if not more expensive. We are however looking into options.

Fetch responded to this but they only responded here. They never contacted me personally. They haven't said what I could do to help besides ""have our vet send more paperwork"" - not WHAT paperwork. And all his vets have sent a ton of paper. When we adopted Loki he just had a cyst on his toe and hair missing from his tail which we were told was due to stress / his previous life.

6344b9c99b12f67dfedd88da,False,False,Unfortunately this insurance company like most is a scam. You have to meet a deductible FOR EACH ISSUE. For example if your pet has urinary issues it’s a $450 deductible for urinary issues before they even pay a lousy 80%. Now if say 2 months later your animal goes in for stool issues that’s a whole separate $450 deductible. Meanwhile it starts out cheap to pay per month but as your pet ages your policy increases. Our cat is 10 and we’re now paying $80 a month for them to cover basically nothing. Ridiculous wouldn’t recommend. You’re better saving that money every month so when an issue arises you can pay it yourself.,1,Unfortunately this insurance company…,2,2022-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,2022-10-11T02:33:13.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/fetchpet.com?page=79

But they were! Our kitty had gone through a URI, then a lung infection, then got diagnosed with Congestive heart failure and more heart problems. It was a very hard time for us... However, everything was covered according to the policy and no major issues. My only complaint is that I really had to track down historical documentation, although Fetch had all the information of my vets (location, numbers etc.) visits and they said they would fax or call for my cat's records, but it didn't really happen.

633af1cb4a5fff53cad53660,False,False,"Fetch has been a life saver for us! It started with a skin infection on our dog Wilson's nose that got completely out of hand. Fetch's customer service was responsive and patient when I contacted them in June 2022 about how to correctly file a claim and what sort of documentation they would require. 

Wilson then tore his cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) in his back left leg not even 2 full months later in August 2022 and ended up needing TPLO surgery that he received in September 2022. During his surgery they did a biopsy on his nose because it still hadn't cleared up after months with treatment. From the biopsy it turns out he also has an autoimmune disease which we are able to proceed with a dermatologist in regards to thanks to Fetch. 

We had to use half of what we had saved up to buy our first home for Wilson's surgery, post-op care (including rehabilitative physical therapy) and other issues that have come up around the same time, but thanks to Fetch we are able to get a majority of that back while getting Wilson the absolute best care.

We've had experience with a different pet insurance company with our previous dog that crossed rainbow bridge due to lymphoma and it was not a positive one. That experience led us to look for another pet insurance when we got Wilson which is when we found PetPlan which later became Fetch. Fetch has always managed to process our claims and reimburse us in about a week's time while our previous experience with the other pet insurance  company left us waiting months for reimbursement and updates on the status of where they were at with processing our claims for chemotherapy.

Our experience has been so positive that we have been recommending Fetch to all of our friends and family since Wilson's leg injury.

632a0bce7f7a8621ee60d5a4,False,False,"Thank goodness for Fetch! I just got a new kitten and thankfully because of the deal Fetch has with North Shore Animal League the 15 day wait period was waived, because on exactly day 14 the kitten tried to make a jump that was too big and hurt his back leg and wouldn't put any pressure on it. After spending a weekend in and out of ERs (because of course I was away from home when it happened and had to go to a different ER once I got home that had a surgeon I needed) I had bills for thousands of dollars. Fetch did as promised and reimbursed 80% which was such a life saver! 

Only reason I didn't give five stars was because of their policy with curable recurring conditions. My kitten had  a feline cold at the shelter that the shelter said was resolved. When I got home it was clear a week in that this wasn't actually the case so I went to a vet to get meds for the lingering cold. When I submitted that claim I found out it wasn't covered because of the policy and that it would have been better for me to never have submitted the claim at all informing them of the ""second"" cold because now instead of one year until a curable condition is covered again, it will be two years until its covered since he supposedly had a cold a second time, and that if he gets a third cold it will be considered incurable and never covered again. So it would have been better if I just never told them about the ""second"" cold at all so that he'd be covered for it again one year out instead of two.",4,Thank goodness for Fetch,1,2022-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,2022-09-20T20:51:58.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/fetchpet.com?page=81

631a09f76a3e1ed2c3cd8f90,False,False,"Honestly, I've been really disappointed with Fetch's customer service, response time and functionality of the app + website. 

The app + website have had numerous log-in issues for over a year. Some of the reps I had worked with in trying to mend this would laugh and just say 'it is what it is and a lot of account are locked out' - not really helpful. It took nearly a year's time to be able to fully access and utilize my account due to technical errors on Fetch's end.

Regarding customer service - I've had claims denied that were clearly new issues. The issues I see here, stemmed from the ability to upload vet records without needing a claim submission. Also, it's unclear on where to upload your first base-line records or just anything that doesn't need an actual claim submission. Think vaccines and routine care. Also, the inability to access my account added to this debacle. Needless to say I've asked for a claim to be rereviewed and it's been over 40 days without an answer or real communication. You don't get to easily work with a claims specialist 1:1 for quick resolutions. 

Another frustrating piece is my cat was diagnosed with diabetes about 10-11 months after my plan had started ( 4 months ago now) and after repeated emails and chats I still haven't gotten an answer on if there are any brand restrictions on glucose monitors and other supplies. 

I do appreciate that Fetch covers exam fees for 'sick' visits but, with all of the above it makes dealing with a sick pet just so much more stressful. The worst part is, if you decide an insurance company isn't for you - you now likely have new issues that will become 'preexisting' if you choose to go elsewhere. So making your initial decision is really important. 

If you're looking for true customer service and a company passionate about your pets as much as you are, I would recommend going elsewhere. But, again my best piece of advice is to thoroughly do your homework on which insurance company is best for you as it's a commitment and not something you can easily change, especially if any new issues arise with your fur baby.",2,Choose wisely.

630bc98f6a3e1ed2c3c33122,False,False,"I purchased my Fetch plan a few years ago.  Recently my 5 yr. old Golden Retriever started acting funny.  She stopped eating and drinking.  After a few days, she curled up in ball and just laid there not moving.  We had to carry her to the car to get her to the vet.

We took her to our regular vet.  No help.  We took her to an emergency animal hospital.  No help.  Finally, we took her to a specialist about an hour from our house.

At this point I had accrued about $1,000 in vet bills.  But the big shock was about to come.  The vet specialist showed me an estimate of just over $6,000 for her treatment.  Having Fetch I knew that I had coverage for her.  But I will be honest, I never tried to use it before.  So I was a little nervous.  Would they actually pay?  I was about to find out.  I authorized the treatment and hoped for the best.  My dog turned out fine.  She is as good as new.  

Following her treatment, I submitted all of my bills to Fetch.  It was soooo easy.  Done right on line.  I was responsible for a $300 deductible and a 20% co-payment.  In less than two weeks I receive a check for about $5,300. 

And even better yet.  The amount was directly deposited into my checking account and I was able to quickly pay off the money I had to borrow for my dog's treatment.

62f5689e8000af4a885bd10c,False,False,"Considering pet insurance? Do NOT sign with 
FetchByTheDodo. After adopting a cat from 
Oregon Humane Society in June, we were incentivized to set up Fetch plans for all of our cats, who were then insured by a pricier company. So we did. Weeks later, our entire household was infected by a parasite that the poor cat brought home. Thankfully he's better now, but our other cats aren't. 
Fetch has denied every claim related to this parasite by labeling the infections as ""pre existing."" We're lucky to have never needed to use our past pet insurance. The last time any of our cats needed a vet visit was 2018. No conditions or illnesses, as documented by our previous insurer. Fetch is able to justify denial because we don't have recent vet records. We did not know that any illness we unwittingly brought home with our new cat would not be covered. We should not have been advised to switch over without also having been communicated the risks.

The latest issue was that MY PREMIUM HAS TRIPLICATED from one moment to another without notice!
Now,  If I want my premium to get somewhat closer to what it used to be, they are forcing me to lower the coverage, duplicate the deductible, etc. 
When I first became a member it was with the promise that the younger the dog was, the insurance would stay lower. 
At this point is as if I was a completely new client with an older- much higher-risk dog. Never mind that my dog has been healthy and the claims for the occasional mild accident or an episode of tummy infection, thus very low claims. 
I am feeling very sad and upset about the injustice. If I knew this would happen, I would have rather paid every visit to the vet out of pocket since we have paid more in insurance premiums than in medical costs.

It wasn't until I submitted for something larger that they broke out previously unknown policy terms to deny my claim. I was misled and told that I can submit claims for anything within the policy year and this was a very nasty surprise. At the end of the day, it is my fault for trusting the customer assistance and information I was given when I first contacted them when I was still shopping around for the best options for my new puppy. I'm really not surprised that an insurance company lied to get business. I probably still have the spreadsheet I made comparing 6+ pet insurance companies that include notes from actually contacting them for policy details. 

Save your money and go elsewhere. We got pet insurance in the first place to cover higher bills but they seem unwilling to actually reimburse. 

My dog now has something that might qualify as a pre-existing condition so we wouldn't be able to even switch providers. Don't let yourself get trapped with this company like we did. 

I also found it extremely distasteful that while they provide you text and email updates on your claim progress, including notifications if it's approved, you don't get any notification of your claim being denied. I strongly suspect that it's because they hope you forget about it until you fall outside of the claim period (which is 90 days, and confusingly not the policy year). The customer service is unhelpful and unwilling. If your claim gets denied, be prepared to receive no good-faith assistance.

Last month she started biting her paws and the vet has advised us that she could be presenting allergies. Fetch has started requesting a significant amount of documents (which they already have) and keep delaying the review of our claim. Unfortunately, it looks like they are looking for the needle in the haystack to avoid covering this problem. It's very unfortunate to deal with companies that are fully focused on making sure you pay your premiums on time but that delay paying out your claims and do provide a clear explanation of why they would need a significant amount of non-related documentation and tests (even from our vet's point of view - ""they are requesting non-related / non-sense information from your pet. Think about switching to other insurance""). 

I would be switching from Fetch to other providers that are more transparent in the claim process.

UPDATE: after requiring additional documentation that wasnt linked to the claim, they have partially approved the claim. However, as mentioned before - interesting enough they have requested medical records for the last 2 years for a dog that has always been insured with them and that has never presented issues.

Well, if each of the 5 times that you brought your pet in was for a different reason your total deductible will be a whopping $1,000. That’s absolutely ridiculous. They also, not only, raised my rates this coming year but they reduced the coverage on one of my pets. They actually told me that the reason they reduced coverage was that they weren’t making enough money off me which I found totally absurd. And the rate hike isn’t even reasonable.

Unfortunately, this experience is bad enough to warrant no more than 1 star. My dog needed behavioral therapy training due to some changing behavior. Our vet referred us to a behaviorist who did a wonderful job. Our plan includes behavioral coverage and specifically states ""behavior therapy."" When our claim was denied, I called to inquire. I was informed that ""in the terms and conditions"" it says that any behavioral training MUST be done by a licensed vet. In our area, there are behavioral training centers, and vets do not do any type of behavioral training, hence the referral (not sure if it's like this everywhere?). I informed them that I had a referral from the vet and that our vet does not do any behavioral training. I also informed them that it was a licensed ""behavioral therapist"" that performed the training. I was told there was nothing I could do or send in to get it covered due to the wording in the terms and conditions. 
Advertising in policy documents and coverage details that behavioral therapies are covered, but only covering them if performed by a certified vet (which is not listed in the policy documents with behavior coverage, and is ONLY in the terms and conditions) strikes me as a company that is trying to trick people into paying for services that should be covered under their plan.

I am to have Fetch pet insurance. At this moment, my beloved dog Lily is being treated for cancer, and knowing that we can count on Fetch to help lessen the financial burden and ensure she can receive the treatment she needs means the world to me.

The Fetch app is also great and easy to use. I just upload the invoice and medical records after each visit, and the claims approval process has been very quick, usually approved within a few days and now even better direct deposit is available. Lily has been going to chemo every week now for five weeks, and each week I just go to the app and upload the documents as a continuing claim.

I’ve been with Fetch (formerly PetPlan) since I adopted Lily over 11 years ago, and before that with Sophie when the company was PetPlan. I’ve seen the claims experience evolve from paper forms to now an app, and the process has become streamlined. The only thing I miss is being able to talk to a claims person more easily, as all communication now seems to be done via chat and email. I recently submitted an estimate for pre-authorization (meaning I wanted to know what coverage would be), and even though it was marked as such in the email it became a claim in the app that kept requesting an invoice; I never got an answer on the coverage but the good news is Lily did get the procedure done and it was covered as expected.

Sophie had insurance with a different company before PetPlan/Fetch, and the experience was terrible; they denied claims even when her vet wrote letters in support of
coverage, and luckily I found PetPlan and was able to switch. PetPlan/Fetch was able to provide coverage when she got cancer, and ensured that finances would not prevent me from getting her treatment.

I originally got pet insurance after meeting a woman at the dog park one day. The woman was looking through the fence and crying. I asked her if she was okay, and she tearfully explained that she had just had to put her dog to sleep because the dog needed treatment she could not afford. She said Sophie reminded her of her dog.

626aa0370c4813f76bf7482c,False,False,"When Fetch was Petplan- it was amazing, now Fetch has fallen short in my books.
My dog (accident prone) has had a handful of insurance claims (when Fetch was still Petplan)- with the last claim being in 2019. My monthly premium went up- totally fair. Today, over three years later I go to submit a claim and see my deductible is now $750 (was $200 with Petplan), with my claim being $600 and my deductible being so high it covers nothing. Fetch has also decided to only cover 70% where as Petplan covered 80%.
My dog was attacked and lost half his ear- a complete freak accident - THE REASON WE GET INSURANCE for our pets.

When calling and speaking to a representative I was told because of my claim activity they had to pay out over 3% above my premiums and deductibles (over three years ago)… is that not the intent of insurance? With my monthly premiums being $32 x12 months, x3 years, that’s roughly $1100 Fetch has in their pockets and will not be covering any part of my first claim in over three years. Just food for thought.

Yes, I should have carefully read the documents when Fetch took over Petplan- however we were assured that nothing would change and coverage would remain the same. Policy holders ensure you are fully reading your new/adjusted contracts with Fetch. 

Will be switching to a new company without a doubt. Sad to see Petplan go through so many changes yearly with new underwriters etc. I whole heartedly support pet insurance to help provide the best care for our animals, however very disappointed with Fetch.",1,Fetch falls short- BEWARE!,5,,2022-04-28T16:09:59.346Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/fetchpet.com?page=92

In 2020, $54. 6-year old dog. No health issues. I have been a customer for 3 years. Never missed a payment....never had a single claim. Not one. Yet, a 40% increase, hey, no problem. When I spoke to customer service all they said was 'yeah, that's the new plan cost now for your policy now'. I asked why the jump? They said, 'that's the cost now for your dog and policy'. I asked - am I getting more coverage? She said, 'no, that's the same coverage now.' It seems ever since the company was purchase, everyone is getting gauged.  I have already contacted Trupanion. They have provided a quote that is based on the cost of vet care and does not have a max payout (which is their business model). I asked that they call me back to revert this cost. I don't think they will, nor is it in their interest. It's really up to AXIS Reinsurance Company (the underwriter). A real shame. They really had a good and fair service (an increasingly tougher way to describe insurance companies, these days).

After 2 vet visits we did not file claims for, that first vet wanted us to go elsewhere to explore why our cat was anemic. This anemia was NOT diagnosed until after our 2-week initial period with Fetch.

The ultrasound they did to look for an ulcer, found lympoma instead. This CANCER was also NOT previously diagnosed.

In the week or so where we were trying to figure out whether it would be better or worse to put our 16 year old cat through surgery to formally diagnose cancer...he stopped eating, and we brought him in for IV fluids and pain medicine, but he still wouldn't eat, and kept declining, so we had to make the awful decision to let him go.

Guess what Fetch did for us?

First, they demanded medical records dating back 2 YEARS, when they knew (via claim form submittals, phone calls, and email) that we only adopted him a few months prior.

Then, they have the gall to blame his needing ultrasounds AND 24/7 IV and pain meds, and then euthanasia...on IBD!  No.  We would NEVER put a cat to sleep because of the IBD we knew he had.  We put him to sleep because he wasn't eating or drinking and because his labs showed CANCER.

Of course, if they blame his IBD they get to call it ""pre-existing condition"".

AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. We will be resubmitting with highlights showing where the vets suspected anemia and cancer.  But to be required to show 2 years of background records, and to be told we put our cat to sleep because of IBD (despite SOAP report describing LYMPHOMA) is appalling.

I can't submit new claim forms online because our policy is no longer active, as of the date we had to let our cat go.

6230a6db31617ac0e486f7e4,False,False,"My initial review was deleted so here it is again, as this is something I would have loved to see before purchasing this pet insurance, hope it helps someone.

Here is my original review 
""If your dog is going through anxiety, guarding issues, and being human aggressive, keep on looking for another insurance. Or make sure you read the fine print... When these guys say they cover ""Behaviorist therapy"" if that behavior therapy involves training your dog with a behaviorist to modify their behavior, don't hold your breath or expect Petplan Fetch to reimburse you. Apparently, training is not considered by them a part of behavior therapy for dogs""

Fetch tells you training is covered on their site, but when you file a claim, they tell you they ONLY cover it if the training happens in a place where there is a vet on staff. 

Have you ever gone to your vet and had them also train your dog? I doubt it. So if your vet diagnoses your dog and recommends medication and TRAINING as part of behavior therapy, that is still not good enough. You MUST train your dog in a place that has a vet on staff. I've been searching for a place like this, does not seem to exist. I asked Fetch to give me an example of a place with a vet and trainer on staff, and they could not come up with a single location.

Below is what's posted on the Fetch website where they advertise they cover training, but it is not true, as a vet recommendation is not enough. They will tell you they cover the vet-suggested treatment for behavioral issues, then tell you that they do not cover training for behavioral disorders in the same sentence. It's crazy! 

""Fetch pet insurance does cover behavioral training. So if your vet recommends that you see a trainer to help address your pet’s behavior, that will be covered. We’ll also cover any anxiety medication that your vet prescribes""

Worse of all, when you talk to them on the phone, they seem to really not care about the discrepancy with what they offer, vs what they deliver.

So if you are looking to get this insurance to help your pup with behavior issues, or just want to make sure you are covered in case your brand new puppy or rescue develops them, I recommend you explore all your options before you commit to Fetch.",1,LYING when they say they cover Behavior Therapy,1,,2022-03-15T14:46:51.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/fetchpet.com?page=96

This is by far the best pet insurance I have found throughout the research I have done. Clark is now a little over 1 year old and he is a perfectly healthy boy. He is a rescue and I thought I wouldn't need pet insurance until he was a little older but I was wrong. Puppies get into a lot due to natural curiosities and their immune systems developing. 

Fetch pet insurance has been truly amazing. Clark's first year alone, Fetch has more than paid for itself. Reimbursements do take some time, but the communication levels are top notch, the staff has always been more than helpful and they are more than fair with claims thus far with me at least.

61faf3d4a16c1e751f7cbc0d,False,False,"When I got our first dog, I did tons of research. I am in a business where reading small prints is routine. So I did. PetPlan (now Fetch) was the best option for me as it allowed to customize your coverage and the deductible wasn’t per-case but annual. The last part of huge. Consider most visits are new cases, especially when dog is young, you will constantly be in new deductible field. 
Now, you have to make sure you do your part to have a smooth experience. I had my dog checked right after she joint the family and had letter from vet certifying that she was completely healthy. Then, make sure to have regular check ups and all vaccines. 
First time we had to deal with large bill, when she was bitten by a raccoon, I was concerned - will insurance make problems?  After I submitted the claim, I waited, and then phone rang.

61eeed30e1196e51d76dcdae,False,False,"Gio, our beloved English Retriever came to us fully insured by his breeder, a Veterinarian from Champaign, IL over 10 years ago.  During Gio's first year of life---he experienced a shoulder injury while playing with a neighbor's dog---which lead us to his first joint surgery and insurance claim.  Playing at a puppy daycare led to ACL ruptures and back to back TPLO's (Back joint replacements ) when he was 4---2 large claims in the same year. All three surgeries were covered at 80% minus the deductible with no questions ask.  There were no claims filed for him from 2015 to September of 2021 when his vet discovered a mass (oral melanoma) in his upper palate. We chose  radiation therapy and a series of immunotherapy vaccines to shrink the mass and stabilize his quality of life.  He started limping during this time and was treated for an infection in a back digit/toe which didn't heal and the biopsy revealed a carcinoma resulting in the amputation of his toe which gave him back complete mobility. Gio began struggling with some labored breathing this past week and had made arrangements for him to be euthanized at home after a confirmation that the melanoma had metastasized in his lungs.  We took him out on Saturday morning to potty and he gently laid down in our backyard, closed his eyes and is now in Dog Heaven running free. I had received an email last week from Fetch asking for us to write a review, but went over our account so that I could be accurate with my review today.

61ed990fa16c1e751f7229b6,False,False,"My family is so very thankful that I purchased Fetch pet insurance for my 3 year old labradoodle Bentley when he was 8 weeks old back in June 2018. When Bentley was 2 years old I noticed he was licking the tip of his tail a lot. After inspecting his tail I noticed there was a small ""pimple"" on his tail that he would lick so much it would be raw and turn into a scab. After months of watching this I went to my vet who said we'd keep an eye on the size of it. After almost a year I noticed the ""pimple"" was getting larger and went back to the vet. She informed me that the ""pimple"" grew and I should now go to an Oncologist for a consultation. I spoke with the Oncologist who booked me an appointment and notified me of the cost. It was substantial but I knew that with Fetch on my side I would be covered 80% of the cost. Long story short, the ""pimple"" on Bentley's tail ended up being an extremely rare cancerous cyst which the doctor said was so rare there wasn't a lot of known cases she could refer to. The Oncologist recommended amputating Bentley's tail because they could not remove the cist and stitch the tail because there wasn't enough skin to close the open wound.  Three months after the amputation Bentley went in for a follow up  X-ray to check to see if the cancer had spread and to our disbelief it spread to 3 ping pong sized lymph nodes in his stomach and he went in for emergency surgery. Thankfully the surgery was a success and Bentley had 6 rounds of radiation and he has just finished his 4th chemo treatment with 2 more treatments to go. Last week he had X-rays to check his lungs to see if the cancer had spread and as of now we are thrilled to report it has not. Bentley was diagnosed in April 2021 with an Aprocrine Cyst Carcinoma on his tail and in September 2021 with Metastatic Neoplasm Adenocarcinoma.  The cost of Bentley's treatments was very expensive and Fetch reimbursed us so far over $21,000.  I can honestly say Bentley would not be with us today if we didn't have medical coverage. It was the best decision we ever made and I strongly encourage all pet owners to purchase health coverage in their pets the way they cover their family. Bentley is truly part of our family and we hope and continue to pray he remains healthy and a big part of our family for years to come.

61eca199a16c1e751f71a574,False,False,"I'm torn on how to rate Fetch. I've had my dog insured with Fetch for several years now under a fabulous plan that I freely chose -- 90% benefit coverage with unlimited annual benefits, with a $200 per illness/injury deductible. I chose this level of coverage because I never want to be faced with the situation of having to choose to withhold needed medical care for my pooch because I cannot afford it; however, Fetch's yearly premium increases are insane, with this year's being the most absurd ever. My policy renewed this year at a 42% premium increase!!!!! I just about had a heart attack when I received my renewal letter. I'm now paying $3500 this year to insure my 11-year-old dog who suffers from severe heart disease. So, while Fetch's coverage is excellent and their customer service has been great all these years, their premiums are outrageous. I told a Fetch rep a couple weeks ago through their Live Chat that insurance of all kinds on humans (auto, homeowners, health, life, LTC, etc.) doesn't even increase by 42% in a year. Then I get the usual spiel from the Fetch rep......well, you can lower your premium by lowering your benefits. Yeah, I get that -- you get what you pay for. But really, if you choose Fetch, be prepared to pay. Their website, customer service and the time it takes to reimburse on claims are all great, but you pay for that. And, despite what they recently emailed to all policyholders ensuring us that Fetch did not increase premiums to cover their recent rebranding efforts, I do not believe it. The entire rebranding of any company is very costly and they have to get money to pay for that from somewhere. Premiums are an insurance company's biggest source of income.

My dog has been very sick and I’ve had to take her to the vet a couple times a week.  Fetch has a convoluted way of handling claims.  One of my claims was broken down into 5 separate claims and when I did the math to see how much I should be reimbursed it was way off from what I was actually paid.  I spoke to a supervisor and they also noticed mistakes so they sent it back to claims.  I had to wait 4 weeks for it to be reimbursed and it still seems wrong.  I called customer support and they also said it’s not clearly explained how they came up with a random number to reimburse me so she downloaded documentation on her end and emailed it to me.  Now I have to download and print out all of the documentation that is not listed in my account online and try to figure out how much I should be reimbursed.

They recently gave me a hard time about not taking my eight week old puppy to the vet in the 60 days prior to coverage, despite the fact that I did not own her until the policy started. I was penalized for being a proactive owner. Another interesting choice by this company. 

They also claimed a condition that was not seen until her adult teeth sprouted was ""pre-existing"" and refused to cover treatment, which was extremely expensive.
