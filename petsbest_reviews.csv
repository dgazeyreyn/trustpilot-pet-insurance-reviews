I picked them because they were the most competitive for a ""higher value"" policy (unlimited annual coverage, $500 deductible, 90% coverage over deductible, and small adder to cover diagnostic fees).

Despite having an Essential Wellness policy, my claim for a Vetco package, Pup Shield Pro, did not cover services like rabies and other vaccinations, fecal exams, and microchipping, which should have been covered. The package was a cost-effective choice that should have benefited both parties. Under the EssentialWellness Endorsement of my policy, I pay premiums with the expectation that preventative care for Cola is covered. What I am requesting is entirely within the reasonable expectations of my policy's provisions and a standard request that should have been easily addressed. Instead, it led to a tedious back-and-forth with PetBest and Vetco, which was frustrating and concerning for the handling of potential future claims. I urge PetBest to consider this as constructive feedback for improving their customer service and claim process, reflecting the integrity and reliability policyholders expect.

**Some things that people need to understand about pet insurance- pre existing conditions are a thing. Do not purchase this insurance (or any other pet insurance for that matter) AFTER a condition is diagnosed and expect to be reimbursed. That’s not how it works. Also, read the fine print and understand how your bill works. There are copays and premiums do increase every year based off of the plan you choose and the age of your dog (human insurance works the same way). In my experience the premiums increase about $50 per year, as the dog ages. And I stress- read the fine print!

They reviewed the bills quickly, and I received reimbursement for a significant portion of Zoe's treatment within a few days of each submission.

65d79920224add74bd6ce428,False,False,"The good:
Filing claims is easy
Reimbursement CAN be fast (some claims are filed and reimbursed within one credit card billing cycle) 
Customer service does not seem to be outsourced, are efficient, follow up with your questions, and are not pushy.
It's great to reduce costs when you have a young dog and an emergency situation arises.

The bad:
Fine print - your co-pay comes out BEFORE your deductible so you can end up paying more than anticipated.
Doesn't cover routine dental (other than the case scenario below)
Exam visits are only covered if you choose the higher cost plan/they are a-la-carte coverage 
Doesn't cover annual visits - you need a secondary wellness plan and it's not super cost effective unless you're getting spay/neuter (the spay neuter cost can apply to a dental cleaning but any dental cleaning I've had had been SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the $150 limit)
Wellness plan didn't cover the entire cost of yearly vaccines, and covers some things that aren't standard care/necessary so overall cost savings is marginal bc to use all your benefits you have to do ""extra"" screenings.
The cost for my older dog skyrocketed between age 7/8 (raised 40%) 


Overall:
It's a decent plan if you have a young dog and have an emergency situation or a lifestyle that is higher risk for sickness or accidents, and you're not good at saving money. (My 1.5y/o dog broke his leg and I was happy I had the insurance bc we just gave carte blanche to do what needed to be done to fix him. However any cost savings will be negated after holding insurance for two dogs for 2 years)
OR
 if you have an older dog where you're concerned about age-related illnesses and don't want to worry about cost of care for potential issues like kidney failure, cancer, etc. 
I would NOT recommend the wellness plan unless you're already interested in doing the full range of screenings/care covered and want a marginal cost reduction.

Was informed that it was due to inflation, the price when up 49.9%. Then the customer service rep realized the new policy added was not permitted in the underwriting and removed the exam fees policy that was just added. This was the mistake of the previous customer care rep made but, regardless apparently it had to be removed. So if it is not allowed how was it added in the first place?

65d255ecb5c5d8c832926741,False,False,"I am a walking billboard for Pets Best!  as a matter of fact I have sent links to other fur parents in the waiting room of vet hospitals for Pets Best to encourage them to get insurance for their babies so they can get the best care for them without breaking the bank. 

I have had Pets Best insurance coverage for my Phoebe ( purebred Persian cat) since I got her at age 8 months. I did everything I could pre adoption to make sure she was healthy but since we have had her, we’ve had two medical incidents, the latest now chronic and I don’t know how we could have gotten through it without the fantastic coverage and experience with PB. 

I’ll detail the things that are difference makers for us:
1) Affordability - for the coverage we have ( includes breed specific underlying conditions, $250 deductible, $5,000 annual limit) the monthly premium is so reasonable and worth every penny ( we hit our annual limit last year) 
2) Easy no hassle process-  unlike human health insurance the claims submission process is sooooo easy. I just request all my providers to email me the receipt and paid invoice or I take a photo of my cat’s medicine container with the prescription receipt and just forward the email to the claims email along with our policy number. ( no email copy necessary) and they follow up with a confirmation of receipt and you can then look on the website to see the status. On the rare occasion that I had a question because a claim needed more info, I got a human on the phone immediately and they were instantly helpful and they clearly care about you and your pet. I have never had a legit claim disputed which I don’t take for granted. 
3) GREAT FAST coverage-  I didn’t buy the preventative plan but for EVERYTHING associated with the medical issues I have had ( excluding the explicitly stated items like deworming which I imagine is due to care and condition issues that are the owner’s responsibility) no hassles and the claims are processed quickly and i get the checks in a timely fashion 100% accurate which helps with my cash flow given the credit card due date for the payment. 

Be smart and do yourself and your fur babies a favor and give yourself peace if mind and look into getting insurance for your pet and definitely consider Pets Best. I am so grateful I did it. Good luck.",5,I am a walking billboard for Pets Best,0,2023-10-18T00:00:00.000Z,2024-02-18T21:09:32.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=9

659c6d20ce2547235d7f20b7,False,False,"I purchased 3 policies for my two dogs and one cat. At the time of purchasing my cat's policy I decided to add a wellness plan since he would be getting neutered soon. It only made sense financially to opt in to the wellness plan if I were able to cancel it after his neuter procedure was complete. I was careful to research that I would be able to cancel the wellness plan before adding it to his policy, otherwise I wouldn't have purchased the wellness plan to begin with. My diligent online research confirmed that I would be able to cancel the wellness plan and keep the accident/illness insurance. 3 months later, after spending $1,400 to cover all three pets, I am unable to remove the wellness plan online so I call in. The customer service agent told me that they don't permit cancellation of the wellness plan until the policy renewal (1 year) which differs from the information I found on their website prior to purchasing the wellness plan. This situation leaves me in a predicament, as I am now obligated to continue paying $57 per month for a wellness plan that no longer serves its purpose. The reimbursement from Pets Best for the neuter procedure was minimal compared to the actual cost I paid the vet, making this experience feel like a significant financial burden and a disheartening waste of money.

I urge you to review and rectify this policy discrepancy to ensure that future customers are provided with accurate information before making crucial decisions about their insurance plans. Transparency and integrity in your policies are essential for building trust with your clientele.

656f6873a45f5cc9138b26eb,False,False,"Allow me to distill my extensive grievances with your abysmal company into 5 key issues:

1) The spay wellness claim was erroneously closed, leading to an exhaustive struggle to elicit acknowledgment. Despite consistent weekly follow-ups, progress with your team remained elusive. Absurdly, it was rejected due to a supposed lack of 12 months of medical records – a baffling demand for a 7-month-old pet. Even after addressing the issue with a manager, it took over 40 days for the claim to be processed, with my insistence that the clock be measured from the original claim date of 10/20.

The medical claim, unjustly denied as a pre-existing condition, was, in reality, deemed non-existent. The absurdity of labeling a perfectly healthy state as ""pre-existing"" is confounding and calls into question the validity of your evaluation process.

The deplorable state of your customer service is undeniable. The automated chat and phone prompts are not only nauseating but also appear to be deliberate attempts to avoid direct communication. Online agents displayed rudeness, a lack of concern for my issues, and an eagerness to hasten the chat's conclusion. The canned responses of ""please allow blah blah days"" were not only insulting but also unhelpful. Even phone interactions, marginally better, still represent the worst customer service I've ever encountered. The only redeeming aspect was the acknowledgment and apology from the manager I eventually spoke to.

The inconsistency in claims processing time is unacceptable. The prompt payout of the first claim on 8/18 contrasts starkly with the swift denial of the second, while subsequent claims have languished for months without resolution.

The inadequacy of coverage and the exorbitant cost are glaring issues. Receiving a mere $150 reimbursement for a $500 wellness spay is ludicrous. Despite paying over $1,200 in premiums and medical bills for routine wellness and a single cleared medical concern, Pets Best has approved a meager $255 reimbursement, with $150 still pending. The savings of $20 compared to not using have the insurance at all hardly justifies the considerable time and frustration spent dealing with your subpar service.",1,Absolutely Abysmal Experience,1,2023-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,2023-12-05T20:14:11.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=17

655261a001bd612f7fca553e,False,False,"There are pet insurances out there that will actually be beneficial… this one isn’t it. To start off at the smallest complaint, you are never reimbursed in time. It consistently takes a couple months for me to hear back. 
Second, their math just isn’t mathing. I spent $600 at an emergency vet hospital and only got $293 back. Somehow the insurances math is to take a deductible AND copay for each individual treatment even tho it was at one vet apt. Let me explain better. My dog was attacked so he had to get wound one flushed, wound two flushed, wound three flushed, all three wounds looked at, two different medications, a shot and an examine. Instead of doing one copay for the visit the insurance charged me 10 co-pays and 10 deductibles. One copay and deductible per thing the vet did at the hospital. 
Thirdly, my dog received a laceration to the face because he accidentally cut his snout on a corner. Then he got attacked (above) which resulted in a laceration. Now his insurance won’t cover any other cuts/lacerations for 18 more months. 
Fourth, i rescued a second dog and immediately got him insurance as well. 48 hours later i was told that his insurance was active and i could start using it. Great. So we go to the vet for an all over exam and find out that he has a rare form of kidney disease in the very early stages. I did this 10 days after i was told his insurance was good to be used. Well the insurance company won’t cover anything to do with his kidney ever because it was diagnosed before 14 days after his insurance was activated. 
Fifth, three months into my second dogs insurance he got a slight tear to his acl. Pet insurance won’t cover any of it either because it happened before the 6th month mark.

Unfortunately for me, my pet has conditions now that would be considered ""pre-existing"" to other insurance companies, and therefore would not be covered. So I'm stuck.

Anyways, my main issues with Pet's Best are:
1) Historically speaking, their claim processing is so, so incredibly slow. The average wait time to hear back from a claim would be 3-5 weeks, with a strong likeliness towards the end of that range. 
2) They go through incredulous lengths to prevent you from meeting your deductible. What I mean by this is that they actually apply your co-pays BEFORE you meet your deductible. So let's say your deductible is $200 and your reimbursement is 70%, your plan covers your event and the bill is $175. You would think since that event is applicable, that $175 would be applied to the $200, leaving you with $25 left in your deductible. Simple, right? Nope. With Pet's Best, they will calculate your co-pays rates on that $175, as if your deductible was already met. So that $175 you thought was going towards your deductible is actually just $122.50 (70% (reimbursement rate * $175 (covered event) ). When I shopped around with other insurance companies, because I was dissatisfied with Pets Best, the reps I would talk to were actually surprised by this policy.

When I started using pets best back in 2021 they were great, but in 2022 they upped the price from 90 to 115. That in itself would have been fine, but after one tooth extraction they started denying every claim I sent in for odd reasons. (example below because I hate long winded reviews -- despite writing a very long winded review) 

NOW, the policy is up for renewal for 2023 and has jumped up to 168 a month. This is more than double what it was when I started. I understand age-related risks, but the whole point is to get coverage early so that you can have security later in life yes? There's no loyalty to a long-term member or long-term coverage for elderly pets.

Ok so can I cancel this policy easily now that its doubled the original agreement? Of course not! No I have to call their support center-- super sus business practice, by the way!

You know what else is wild? I checked to see what the same exact coverage would be if I had a new account, and I was quoted $99.05/month. Much closer to my original quote, even though my cat is 2 years older than when I started. Do with that what you will.

So far I have spent $1833.47 in monthly premiums. Pets best has reimbursed $1247.56 (meaning from just a cost to cost comparison I've lost -$585.91) and I have paid $1178.05 in charges not covered (or wrongfully denied.)

(BONUS) Example of a wrongful denial: 
They claimed my cat getting stressed and not eating after I went out of town (thus needing IV fluids) was a ""pre-existing condition"" -- She had no pre-existing conditions by their contract's definition when we started, anyways. But that didn't change the result.

Edit: Attempted to use the live chat feature as suggested in pets best's reply. There are ""too high of volume of chats"" to connect with an agent -- this again, redirects you to calling their support line. (This option doesn't show on certain browsers, if you don't see it try firefox)

And, as they put it, ""different underwriters"" can cause you to pay double what other members are paying for the same coverage. Again, do with that what you will.",1,Get a savings account instead,0,2023-09-29T00:00:00.000Z,2023-10-01T13:04:16.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=25

Like upholding your end of the deal and later realizing the company won’t fulfill theirs? Then this insurance is for you! My kitten developed eye redness after we purchased the insurance plan, and I went to the vet. The vet mentioned in the note that the cat had occasional sneezing (not the actual reason we went there, just as a side note). When it came to reimbursement, the claim was denied because the occasional sneezing was deemed as a “respiratory infection”, which, intern, was deemed a “chronic condition.” The cat had a history of upper respiratory infection prior to adoption, and hence they claimed it’s a pre-existing condition. I don’t know if the people reviewing the claims are smart fraudsters or just stupid, but as a physician, I can attest that it is not how URIs work. You are “allowed” to have them multiple times a year, it is not a “pre-existing” condition like cancer or diabetes; each episode, if spaced out in time, is a brand new instance. Furthermore, this has nothing to do with eye redness (conjunctivitis) for which the cat was treated for with ophthalmic antibiotic and had a corneal exam. Over a dozen hours were spent communicating with the insurance reps and countless neurons destroyed by the stupidity of their reasoning... Needless to say, I’m no longer their customer (they had the nerve sending me an invite to resume my membership; like yeah, why wouldn’t I!), and now I’m putting away the amount I would’ve paid for monthly premiums into a savings account, self-funding my pet emergency account, knowing that if I have an emergency, there will actually be money to cover my expenses.",1,Parody on insurance,1,2022-09-29T00:00:00.000Z,2023-09-24T16:02:44.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=26

650f287ad7ac303ee3623972,False,False,"I am very happy with the coverage and ease of filing a claim. 

However, my premiums have now increased 45% on a 2 year old insurance policy for a dog that is less than 3. That’s pretty steep and a poor business practice, in my opinion. People will either cancel the policy or make more trips to the vet to justify the cost of coverage. 
The claim reimbursement is also now taking considerably longer than when I first took out the policy. Pretty typical, more money for less service. 

Not sure how much longer I’ll keep the policy. At a certain point you might as well just put what you’d pay in premiums, into a savings account to cover expenses and have your own insurance policy. At least that way if you don’t need treatment for your pet, you’re not throwing your money away.  I understand it’s a business that needs to make a profit, but a 45% increase in just 2 years is a bit absurd. 
If the upward trend in premium costs continue at this rate, I’ll most likely cancel the policy. If not, at this rate of increase, I could end up spending over $30K in premiums (not factoring in a $250 deductible and the co-pay) on a dog with a life expectancy of around 13 years.

We were definitely grateful to have it as it helped tremendously with the bills.  That being said, Pets Best offers a much better policy than our previous insurance.  We love that we can pick our deductible and % back to meet our budget.  Pugs come with so many allergy, ear and other issues that we never want to be without insurance.  Pets Best makes it extremely easy to turn in claims and the turn around rate on receiving our % back is rather quick.  They are much better than most companies in that there is no limitation to the amount received during the year and many hereditary/congenital conditions are including when signing on your puppy at a very young age.  This is one of the best ways to assure they stay healthy.  I am constantly recommended them to everyone I know as well as all of my friends on social media.  They really are the best.  I hope that we have a very long relationship with them.  We are about to bring home another puppy soon and will be adding them to our current policy.  Also, just a note - their 24 hour chat/call in case you just need to ask a tech - the BEST - sometimes you just aren't sure if you need to go to the ER vet or if it can wait and these people are always there and truly a help.

I had a 90% reimbursement plan and a 100% reimbursement plan. Untimely leaving me with a very sour taste in my mouth.

Later on he ate a piece of wood and had to have an xray and followup with the ER (cost around 600$) and lastly he all of sudden started having blood in his poop and had to go to the ER for checkups and was put on some good amount of medication (cost around 500$).

After every incident I simply created a new claim on the pets best app (very simple to use and never failed me). 

I never needed to call anyone in pets best customer service ( I always got my money transferred into my bank account within two weeks of each incident) they where reliable and fast every time with no exceptions.

64baf8f943a497da9c49f9c8,False,False,"When I first brought my puppy home, I researched through a list of pet insurances-- you name it, I've likely researched and considered it. I settled on Pets Best after looking at the following personal criteria: 1) Cost, 2) Convenience, 3) Fineprint Restrictions, and 4) Value. Another factor was reviews just like this one, and whether people liked using it or not. 

Pet insurance depends on a lot of things, like location, pet type, breed, as well as the age of your pet, but of all of the insurances I looked at, Pets Best covered the most for my dog and the cost was reasonably competitive (at the time I researched it).

For my dog's most recent ER visit in June 2023, I was able to receive the PDF invoice and payment receipt from our provider and immediately use the app to submit a claim. The whole process took only like 5-10 minutes, and the turnaround is normally relatively quick of about 2-3 weeks, but this time around they had some backlog and a longer wait time, and they were transparent and communicated the delay through email.

Being out $1-2k from a pet ER visit is nerve-wracking for me, and a long wait time means that credit cards will charge interest on it. But so far, with Pets Best, I'm relatively happy with their speed of reviewing and approving claims. I've had instances where they approved partial claims-- but normally they're clear about why it's not fully reimbursed etc. As of this moment, I haven't found any issues with their process. I would definitely recommend doing your own due diligence on insurances, but I can wholeheartedly recommend Pets Best as one of your contenders.",5,"Trustworthy, convenient, and painless where it counts",0,2023-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,2023-07-21T23:30:33.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=35

He is thriving now. So I finally submitted the claims that we had racked up and crossed my fingers to see if they would get paid.  And to my utter astonishment, they DID!!

Their team also DISCOURAGES YOU TO APPEAL CLAIMS. When my ER Vet called Pets Best to send in a letter to supplement a claim appeal, the customer service agent directed for the vet to NOT APPEAL even though the same accident happened in a different situation. The fact that someone who works for Pets Best would try to sway a vet's right to appeal is so unethical and proves that their own staff knows this insurance agency doesn't authentically care about it's pets/owners and does not review each case based on individual circumstances. Once I voiced my discontent with this situation, I still waited 6 months to get an appeal answer (while still paying for a policy that I thought would later support me) and was still rejected.

I've complained about this malpractice of discouraging to appeal multiple times in calls with various agents and asked to speak to a supervisor and was then told to email the main customer service email. I asked to speak to a supervisor over the phone again and haven't heard anything in 4 days.

If you're looking for a pet insurance that genuinely cares and empathizes with their clients and makes you feel supported in stressful times of need, like receiving financial support from $5000 in ER bills, DO NOT select Pets Best. They'll take your money ($2,000 in my case) and not blink an eye when you actually need help.

We requested the highest level of payment at 90/10 the lowest deductible at $100 and we requested unlimited coverage and ordered both wellness coverage and accident coverage. They explained that you could always lower coverage but never add on so we requested the best coverage for everything that they sold.  We were assured the monthly premiums would never be based on our claims but rather on the community costs for our location and they assured us 10% increase was the most they had ever had from year to year and sometimes it would go down rather than up depending on the community costs.  This sounds great but it didn't happen.  Our monthly premiums were raised so high each year as much as 35% increase in one calendar year, and they changed our coverage to 5K in error.  When we requested the phone records to prove our higher coverage they would say they were ordered yet they let one year after another pass without helping us.  We filed a better business bureau complaint but they didn't produce the original records and just denied.  They will price you out so that you basically have a savings program instead of insurance financial help.  Our 6 year old was at $137 per month even after we dropped wellness coverage. By the time your dog is 10 you can expect the fees to be so high you won't have coverage.  Our dog got Leukemia and they are paying only after fees and deductions around 2500 when the chemo and treatment will be 26K and stem cell 48K to 86K.  All of the patients at oncology are getting full coverage for their cancer dogs with their trupanion insurance and we are left to pay all the costs out of our pocket because Pets Best falsified our coverage.  We challenged their error in our records for years before the cancer diagnosis and now we will be in debt and asking for help thru go fund me. Don't let this happen to you.

64263ddd38e3f5aa8c32a0ee,False,False,"PetsBest Insurance is the worst pet company I’ve ever dealt with. They take forever to process a claim stating they are busy with an influx of claims. In my experience with the several claims I have filed, the lengthy time they take to review my claim is solely used to do their very best to collect any info that might disqualify my claim.
My initial claim sat for 3 weeks with no attention. I called several times and was told they had all the info to process my claim. On my final call regarding this particular claim, I was notified that no one has been working on my claim and after 3 weeks and still, no one had contacted my vet for medical records.
I filed a wellness claim that got incorrectly processed as an “illness” claim (twice) under which the services I received were not covered by my medical policy, but were covered almost entirely under my wellness plan (which is of course an additional monthly charge). I called PetsBest and emphasized it was a wellness claim and the claim AND vet records both reflected that fact. The agent helping me said he would make a note about the wellness claim to ensure it would be processed correctly. However, when I was eventually notified of the resolution of these two incorrectly processed claims (since they were YET AGAIN) processed as an illness instead of wellness I did not receive any reimbursement for the visit. Once again I had to resubmit the vet records clarifying that it is a wellness claim NOT an illness. For my wellness claim to be processed (3 months after the visit and original claim submission) the co then stated they needed an itemized bill of the wellness visit in order to process the claim correctly. When I called the vet to request this info the receptionist said she has never had an insurance company request something like that and she doesn’t understand why the insurance co is being so difficult.
My final claim was partially paid out but of course, all the money went back to PetsBest to be paid against my deductible.
I’ve spent over $480 on monthly insurance payments in the course of 3 months. In that time, I’ve spent over $1,000 in veterinary services that were almost all denied reimbursement for.
Using PetsBest insurance was a HUGE waste of time and money as the only payout they approved went to my deductible so that’s more money I wasted on for the insurance co to take forever just to do basically nothing.
Every agent I spoke to told me different info and they say they’ll call you and update you but no one ever does.

It's been about two months since the first claim, minor ear irritation and it still hasn't been paid. I received an email saying that the invoice isn't enough. It needs to be itemized and show that we paid (which it does). We've submitted about 8 claims now, and NOT one has even been processed yet. 

I'm amazed there are reviewers on here saying that they've had their claim turned around in a few days. I have a different insurance for my other dogs and we've never had a claim denied and the money is in my account in a few days. 

It's starting to feel like someone is just going through and marking ""needs me info"" when it's the same format I submit to my other insurance. I've even called in after submitting something and asked if that info is good enough. Got a ""yes"" two weeks ago, and the claim still isn't processed. I can't even tell you if they are good about paying claims because they are just sitting there or asking more info when they have it all. 

I seriously regret getting pets best. Our dog just had a $20,000 bill between 3 surgeries at 2 different hospitals and 2 weeks in ICU. Now it's going to be a pre-existing condition if we leave.

64149b1aef893529efcee9cb,False,False,"3/21/23 - account management team: 
""Any condition for which a Veterinarian provided medical advice, the Pet received treatment for, or the pet displayed signs or symptoms consistent with the stated condition prior to the effective date of a policy or during any waiting period is considered pre-existing and excluded from coverage.""
The waiting period for an illness is 14 days and 3 for an injury.  I saw the vet 12 days in.  The ""stated condition"" referred to above is conjunctivitis, and the vet did not note this condition or any symptoms associated with it but said ""injury."" This ""condition"" was arrived at entirely by the claims dept.
3/21/23 - was told when I contacted to discuss claim again that even with 100% of other decisions noted as errors made by initial reviewer by Pets Best themselves, decision classifying case as an illness and inserting a diagnosis not even suspected by vet would NOT be considered for even a review without an appeal. I was told a supervisor would contact me between 24-48 hours. 
UPDATED: My experience has been negative. I enrolled in Dec 2022 for 5 pets. I've received conflicting information about 3 seperate things related to the claims process. It doesn't seem the people processing claims are reading closely as they denied claims very clearly aligned with the wellness plan. My initial claim was made Jan 27th and included an injury item and wellness items from the same visit. Records were submitted and confirmed to be received in mid Feb.  It took 4 times to have the wellness plan items annotated and covered correctly despite being clearly itemized on my bill. The injury was classified as ""illness - conjunctivitis"", which is listed no where on the medical records. My vet used the word injury.
UPDATE:
Wellness plan claims: 
- Originally my claim denied entirely for $80 wellness exam, the $51 fecal testing and the $14 dewormer, the explanation being that those items were not covered.
- I reached out for a review.The exam was covered and other items ignored. 
- Third review added $6 of the dewormer saying that was the max and the fecal testing was overlooked again.  The wellness plan covers both in the amount of $20 and $50 respectively. 
- 4th review initiated by me covered all wellness items. 
Injury: 
- my kitten was taken in because it looked like he had injured his eye.  He had no symptoms that aligned with conjunctivitis. The vet suspected an injury (annotated on his record sent to pets best), but she performed a diagnostic test for $27 to rule out a cornea ulcer.  It was negative. I was sent home with no meds and the reassurance it would resolve in a day or so.  It did.  Pets Best denied the claim being it was inside the 14 day waiting period and classified it as an illness for conjunctivitis, which was listed NO WHERE on his chart.  I was told by two separate representatives that specifically my issue with it being classified as an illness was being looked at.  A week later, the claim is closed and nothing was addressed about his eye injury.  I contacted pets best and was told that wasn't the correct process, and I had to write an appeal that can take up to 90 days. I'm so angry by the constant misinformation and the clear lack of detail on the initial claims reviewer. The reviewer clearly did not look at the claim closely or the wellness items would not be denied more than once.  But now, I have to file an appeal which can take up to 90 days.  Even though the company sees the initial reviewer messed up 100% of the other items on the initial claim, they completely refuse to review all decisions made by the initial reviewer. They clearly do not care about quality control or customers in refusing to at least review it even with the blatant other mistakes, but put the work on the customer to file more paperwork. 
Moreover, this being annotated as an illness instead of an injury now classifies this as a preexisting condition and therefore anything that presents as conjunctivitis (which this did not) will never be covered.  I find it completely abhorrent a company would blatantly ignore language used by the vet - ""likely injury"" - in favor of words that the vet never used - ""conjunctivitis"" and ""illness"". If the vet suspected or noted conjunctivitis like symptoms, that would be written some where.  None of the symptoms listed for conjunctivitis were present. It's especially abhorrent for non-medical professionals to ignore language used by medical professionals and insert language of their own that would deny future benefits.   At best this gross oversight and should not require an appeal to review.  At worst this is a scam.  I am aware of how to contact pets best. I have had to 5 times.

Absolutely no company accountability about the error in their own UI and misleading information to their customers. Avoid this company like the plague - read the critical reviews and go elsewhere.

Pets best sucks their customer service is atrocious. 

I cancelled my policy on the app and removed my foster dog. They claim they didn’t receive it when I updated status for the dog to be not owned anymore and they made me pay for over two months of premium for  a dog that I did not have. The representative Alex on the phone was absolutely unhelpful she straight away said there was nothing she would do. 

They wouldn’t back date or refund my money, they absolutely could have made an accommodation for their terrible app and membership experience. 


I immediately asked her to cancel for my dog Athena and the foster dog that was adopted out end of October beginning Nov. Alex seriously needs to be given some coaching and training on actually being a better service professional. I am in support and service and I know more could have been done especially given that I have been a customer for a long time. All they care about is their money not about pet care or their own customers. If they actually cared they would have considered their own UI/UX error and made steps to correct. Instead their rep alex doubled down and said there was nothing to be done. 

Abhorrent experience. Will never recommend to any of my family friends or network for their pet insurance needs.

They gave her allergy pills to try; although, it wasn't confirmed that was the issue since she had no other symptoms.  Claim was denied due to being pre-existing.  I've NEVER taken her in for hair loss.    I took her in twice (back to back) at the end of January because she was extremely ill, throwing up and had flu-like symptoms.  Claim was denied due to being pre-existing.  The first visit of those two days was listed as allergies, also, when it was very clear she was in there due to being sick.   How is it possible for a gastrointestinal illness to be a pre-existing condition?    Needless to say, I will not be renewing this policy.  Big scam.  They take your money and deny claims.

UPDATE:  Because my dog had an ear swab for an ear infection prior to the policy, they denied her recent visit when they swabbed her ears to rule out an ear infection.  So they basically will attribute any type of sickness as pre-existing, even though it's an illness that can happen multiple times and is not related to any previous instances.  THIS COMPANY IS A TOTAL SCAM!!

I wish we could respond to their ridiculous answer, which shows that they are a scam, because any type of illness will always be considered pre-existing, even if it's the flu.   They are a SCAM.

I have a policy that covers 90% and unlimited vet visits. I do pay a high monthly premium but Anna is worth it. Plus she's a bully breed so you pay based on breed.
There is usually a wait for claims as well. Sometimes it's a week and others take 3 weeks to a month for reimbursement. The high premium and wait time is worth it.

Recently we submitted a Vet/Hospital claim for one of our dogs, and ever since we are just getting the runaround. I would not do business with them. This has been a horrible experience. It feels like they keep inventing new hoops to jump through hoping we get tired and give up. They have had no problem collecting our payment each month for years, but when we submitted a claim, we're having to battle. 

Here's what's happening: I submitted a claim for a hospital bill and a vet bill for the same problem for our dog, and ever since we have been getting the runaround. Meanwhile, we are out more than $2500. First, Pets Best denied the claims stating that they didn't receive the medical records, even though the Vet and hospital stated that they sent the records and provided email confirmations that they sent the records. 
That required us to take our time to have the Vet resend the records. That day, I confirmed with a Pet's Best rep that they received the records and had everything they needed. Weeks go by and I don't hear or receive any emails from Pets Best, so I call again, and I'm told they now need SOAP notes from the Vet. Of course, they never contacted me to mention this new request or let me know that they didn't receive the needed additional records from the vet. 
Today we are headed to the vet to request the SOAP notes are sent. I'm hoping there will be no new hoops and they will fulfill their end, but after what we have experienced, it doesn't look promising.

63b860a34d0773066a301de5,False,False,"I have been a client of Pets Best since 2019.  We had adopted a Great Pyrenees from a kill shelter down South and had him transported locally.  We have been very fortunate to have adopted a great dog...it clearly could have gone the other way.  

From the beginning we investigated various pet insurers and had narrowed it down to Truepanion (also a good firm) and Pets Best.  That said, we felt that Pets Best had the most comprehensive coverage at competitive prices.  Unfortunately, there weren't many reviews at the time and we wound up taking a chance that Pets Best would live up to their promises.  

Well, I have to say that we clearly made the right choice.  ""Archer"" needed to undergo MPL surgery this year and we were hit with a bill close to $6k.  I submitted the expenses and within 2-weeks had the reimbursement (less the copay) deposited directly in our account.  This insurance more than paid for itself by providing both peace of mind and outstanding coverage.  I've never had an issue with claim denial (even with smaller bills) and their customer service is top notch.  If you are seriously considering pet insurance my advice is take it, but go with a company you can trust.  I would highly recommend them and would encourage anyone to research them.  I noticed that there have been some negative reviews posted, and maybe there have been some situations with others that were less fortunate with their experience.  However, I can say first hand, we have had nothing but positive experiences during our 3-year arrangement with them and I have no reservations about renewing our policy year over year.",5,Honest and they always come through as promised...,0,2022-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,2023-01-06T19:55:47.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=63

My favorite thing about Pets Best is that they have a 24 hour line for medical concerns that is staffed by a vet tech. Otherwise, financially- What I have been reimbursed over the last four years has been far less than what I pay in premiums. It would be helpful if they made an effort to remind pet owners that certain exams or interventions are due at a specific time in order for any subsequent illness to be paid for (for example, you need to subject your pet to anesthetic dental cleaning starting at 3 yrs old even if their teeth are fine, because if something ends up happening afterwards then they won’t pay for it. This happened to me after my boy went from healthy teeth to plaque fast, and I was told by an agent that I now need to pay for costly dental cleaning on my own). The prescription formulary list is pretty small, medications are rarely reimbursed. You would fare better saving your monthly premium into an account to use for when you need routine pet care. Anything seriously costly after that can easily be paid back using a service like Care Credit. If you have a holistic pet store by you, their consultations are usually free with the purchase of the products to help your pet- do that replaces the vet line and comes from a healthier approach.

Second, Pets Best based on incomplete information, and partial evidence to decline exams with reason of ""pre-existing conditions"". ""Pre-existing"" seems to be a super token for them to decline customers' claims for anything they don't want to cover. It's a gray area, so be careful of what you said to your doctor and make sure your doctor got it right to the medical records.  My dog has never been diagnosed with Urination Inconsistency prior my visit in November, 2022. It was only based on my own words mentioning that I noticed some urine dripping about a year ago, but it went away. There is no medical records to prove that my dog has urination incontinence prior my November visit. It's like if your dog had diarrhea a year ago, they would consider anything related to diarrhea is ""pre-existing"". Because of they determined my dog had ""urination incontinence"" as a pre-existing conditions, they don't even cover Urinalysis test. This is outrageous!! Urinalysis is a very common test to see if there's any infection and to seen any abnormal chemicals/ bacteria in the urine. Just based on my own words of ""dripping urine"", they rejected to pay for the urinalysis for rest of my dog's life!! If my words can be used as a diagnose result, I can be a doctor too. I am not a doctor, why they used my mentioning some symptoms I noticed a year ago as a medical condition.  Plus, Pets Best is very dishonest on calculating the payment amount. According to the policy, after customer has fulfilled the deductible, co-pay should be calculated by multiplying anything after the deductible by the percentage of customer's responsibility based on the plan you buy. However, Pets Best used the whole amount (including the original deductible portion) to calculate the co-pay amount that I owe.

639790a3eb0ad8489908dae5,False,False,"We got Pets Best almost 3 years ago after my senior dog had a battle against pancreatitis. It cost us about $8000 to save his life. Originally when we got our dogs, dog insurance was unavailable or not very good so we did not opt in and figured in their older age, insurance companies would either charge crazy premiums or not accept them or not cover very much. After that scare with our dog's pancreatitis, we decided we'd try getting an insurance for our two senior dogs. Many insurance companies would either not cover them or charged an exorbitant amount or only cover 50-60% of the bill. Pet's best accepted our 10 year old seniors at 80% repayment at a decent monthly payment, $500 deductible, while covering an unlimited amount of costs. We decided to accept their quote and here we are three years later. We will stay with them until our dogs pass. Our senior dogs have had all of their ear infections covered, all of their eye conditions covered, including a surgery to remove a bothersome chalazion and cataract removal from both eyes. This totaled over $10,000 and they covered all of it. This insurance was completely worth it to us.

6394ee065873c1cf9fd1db42,False,False,"I was in the market for pet insurance for my 3 cats. After careful consideration and extensive research, I decided to go with Pets Best because of what their coverage included and their competitive prices. 

For all 3 of them, I went with an Annual Deductible of $100, an unlimited annual limit, and a reimbursement level of 90%. I pay $90 total a month for this insurance.

A month after purchasing this insurance I had to take one of my cats to the emergency room, he was going to the litter box constantly and couldn't urinate at all. For those unaware, this can be a serious matter which can lead to the death of your little feline within 48 hours if there is a blockage within their urethra. 

The emergency vet clinic performed the following services for my cat:

A Urinalysis, Culture and MIC: $308
Renal (BUN/CRE/PHOS) Panel-Catalyst: $129
Lyte 4, Lytes:  $74
Buprenorphine 0.5mg/ml: $28
Gabapentin 50mg Tiny Tabs: $80
Emergency Visit: $175
Tube check X-Ray: $176 
Hills C/D FelineCanned Food: $11
UrineCollection (Cystocentesis/Catheterization): $54

Total: $1038

After all his testing my cat had a clean bill of health but they did find some crystals forming within his urethra which was the reason why he kept trying to urinate, we were prescribed some pain-killer medicine and a special food diet that would assist in destroying any remaining crystals. A couple of days after, he returned to normal and no longer had to use the litterbox every 10 minutes. We continued this treatment for 2 weeks and he's 100% back to normal. 

[A word of advice for all cat owners reading this, make sure your cats are getting enough water! A lack of water is a huge reason why crystals form in their urethra, especially neutered tom-cats. Cats mostly get their water intake from food and rarely use the fountains they're provided. We now add an extra tablespoon of water to all their meals whether it's dry or wet, this will insure good kidney health and prevent any urinary issues in the future.]

After the clinic visit, I immediately submitted a claim to Pets Best via their app. I submitted the invoice and emailed them the information about the main vet I go to for my cats. From there they began a review of my claim. 

Within 4 weeks I was notified my claim was reviewed and I was able to see the explanation of what was approved and what wasn't (if any) in detail. 

[The new prices indicated are what was paid out to me because of my insurance plan]

A Urinalysis, Culture and MIC: $177 
Renal (BUN/CRE/PHOS) Panel-Catalyst: $116
Lyte 4, Lytes:  $67
Buprenorphine 0.5mg/ml: $25
Gabapentin 50mg Tiny Tabs: $72
Emergency Visit: $157
Tube check X-Ray: $158
Hills C/D FelineCanned Food: $0 (Not covered due to Prescription diets not being covered by the plan)
UrineCollection (Cystocentesis/Catheterization): $49

Total reimbursement to me: $824

Deductible: $100
Copay: $102
Not covered: $11
Original Total Bill: $1038
New Total Bill with Pets Best insurance: $214


I am very pleased that Pets Best worked and kept everything they promised. I know this review may seem a bit lengthy but I only do it to make sure people know what it is they're getting into. There have been some reviewers who have left negative reviews because they didn't fully understand the policy they purchased so they assume it's a ""scam"". I suggest anyone who is in the market for any kind of insurance to carefully read what is offered and what is not offered so that they know what to expect when they need to use their insurance for themselves or their little furry pet.

If you're reading this and wondering if you should even get pet insurance; consider the following: Would you rather have insurance and not need it, or would you rather not have insurance and need it?

6391ea280b7fc02715d860ff,False,False,"This is a long one…So I purchased my English golden retriever in May 2022. Three days before I took possession of her I decided I would be a responsible pet owner and purchase insurance for her. I decided to go through my car/home insurance (Progressive) which worked with Pets Best. They seemed to have good reviews and I could just add it to my other insurances. I began my policy 3 days before bringing my dog home. Once she was home, it seemed she may have a UTI. I took her to the vet where she was treated for this UTI and she was also referred to Purdue Animal Hospital because the vet thought there MIGHT be something else going on. She did NOT diagnosis her with anything more than a UTI. When I submitted the claim for the UTI it was denied because it was within the first 14 days of the policy start date. Annoying, but fine. Then over a month later (way past the first 14 days) we took her to Purdue Animal Hospital where they diagnosed her with 2 ectopic ureters. She would need surgery which was scheduled for July 5, 2022. 2 MONTHS after I started my Pets Best policy. Now, my husband and myself were not aware of any of these issues when purchasing her. The ONLY thing we were made aware of was that she had an inverted vulva, that was genetic. But all her other issues were just thrown at us by the different vets we took her to. She had her surgery, I submitted the $1300 claim and it was denied for it being a “preexisting condition.” When I contacted them the lady I spoke to seemed annoyed and just said “l’ll email you a dispute form, but it will take at least 90 days to process.” This was obviously discouraging because their regular claims process takes weeks to get completed anyway. As we continued to rack up our credit cards with vet visits to try to get our sweet girl healthy, every single claim was denied. We spent over $4,000 in vet bills on a pure bred English Cream Golden, who for all we knew, had an inverted vulva that would pop itself out in 1-2 heat cycles. Plus we spent our monthly premium to pets best for literally nothing. Oh and the cherry on top. I had one last claim being finished when I already cancelled my policy. Just got the notification that it was completed today. They applied that claim to my $500 deductible!! What!? pretty sure the $4000 we have paid is well over that $500 deductible.

I am about to be evicted because they won’t pay a claim that has been valid & I have never been late with my premium which was $148 a month up until 3 months ago right before I knew about the heart condition - I had to lower the coverage because of my health situation & my financial crisis.

I knew my baby would grow to around 3.5 pounds, so accidents can happen when they are so tiny. I purchased a Pets Best policy after reviewing it very carefully. Well, my baby was playing one day and his kneecap dislocated. This required an ER visit, and ultimately surgery. I found a board certified orthopedic surgeon and trusted his recommendation. He had a successful surgery. Based on a few negative reviews, I wasn't sure that PB would reimburse me as per the agreement, but they absolutely did. Staff were VERY nice to speak with, seemed concerned about my dog, and they processed my claim in 2-3 weeks which I consider timely.

They decided not to cover it even though the soft tissue specialist found that the surgery was needed and proceeded to fix the problem, because it was not recommended by my general vet who I see only for vaccines and accidents.

I've been a customer for years and when I finally needed insurance to help, I was left on the hook.
I took the cat for her annual checkup and dentistry appointment, unfortunately she needed an extraction. I thought I was going to be fine as insurance should have covered it. But, as stated in PetsBest's policy: ""your Pet's teeth must have been cleaned and examined under general anesthesia by a Veterinarian in the thirteen months before the date of service for the Periodontal Disease claim"". Her last examination & cleaning under anesthesia was 14 months prior thus my claim wasn't covered. I barely missed the window by just a bit and now I'm left on the hook for the ENTIRE bill. What a shame, unless you're putting your pet under anesthesia on a yearly basis (not a great idea if you've an aging pet), it's very possible that you'll miss the window to file claims as well. It feels almost unreasonable that they set these strict criteria for coverage. I did find the process to submit a claim rather easy though, so I'll give them that. 1.5 stars
---------

In regard to your reply,
Thank you for responding. However, this boiler-plate response is representative of my qualms with the company policies. My pet was indeed free of any signs of Periodontal Disease prior to the Policy Effective Date and waiting Period. And since the age of three, my pet's teeth have been cleaned and examined under general anesthesia by a veterinarian routinely. However, this last date of service for the Periodontal Disease claim where an extraction was necessary was 14 months ago and thus missed the mark just barely.

632ac484c17abd5d3c355a5c,False,False,"I bought the premium insurance that covers approximately 90% with a $200 deductible as well as wellness. Approximately two months ago, I submitted a claim for an allergic dermatitis. My vet gave a steroid as well as some antibiotics, which came out to approximately $200 and a referral to another dermatologist for further evaluation. The dermatologist proceeded to prescribe two medications and two shampoos in order to treat the condition and the bill was approximately $700.  It took approximately three months for a decision, and I was denied on all parts because either it wasn’t covered or there was more medical records that were needed. During this process, I have called the help center multiple times, and I always get the runaround or broken promises on follow ups. For example, the service desk said that they would give me a call for updates, which never happened, and that they would follow up with my vet, which they never did. I have uploaded the medical records from the vet, but they say that these particular records did not provide enough information. For contrast with a different pet insurance, the same medical records that I uploaded were able to be processed, and the decision was able to be made with dispersement within two weeks.

Please do not use this company! Although this claim was only a few hundred dollars, I’m nervous, that if there was a larger expense, I would not be able to get the appropriate reimbursement. I thought this was a good deal, because they included wellness as part of their insurance, but it seems as though this is a scam. Additionally, I’m worried that if I go with a different pet insurance, I would not be able to get insured because of my pets, pre-existing condition.

Since my 6-month old puppy was eating and chewing everything in sight, I decided it would be wise to purchase accident and illness coverage in case she swallowed something and needed surgery. Never in my wildest dreams would I have expected her to break her leg, but at 10 months of age, she stepped in a hole while running in the back yard. It was a horrible experience. The break was so bad she needed emergency surgery. The bone had to be held together with a plate and screws. 

Needless to say this was very expensive and I was so glad we had purchased insurance. Now came the test to see how well our insurance company would handle this. I submitted the claim with all the appropriate information and waited. It was a very easy online process. 

Much to my surprise, they paid the claim exactly as was stated in the policy without any resistance, arguing, or phone calls. They sent me updates via email regarding their process, and when all was said and done, a deposit appeared in my bank account. Because of the severity of the injury, our pup needed follow-up visits and additional x-rays on several occasions, but they were all covered. 

I am more than pleased with the exceptional service provided by Pets Best! It was a welcomed relief after experiencing that horrible injury and the ordeal of recovery.

By the way, our pup is well on her way to a full recovery and she is so happy to be running again. : )

62c9b3d50c20b4453c34c385,False,False,"We've had PetsBest coverage for both our dogs for years now. PetsBest really came through for us with our older dog when he had TPLO surgery several years ago. Our recent experience with PetsBest began as my wife and I were driving with our two dogs to visit family out of state. On the first day of our drive, our younger dog started vomiting. Unfortunately, even after we had reached our destination and she had several days to settle, her vomiting didn't stop. Being over a thousand miles from home and our primary vet made for a stressful situation. We ultimately made the decision to take her to a Vet ER where she received excellent care and recovered slightly with anti-nausea medication. However, once we returned home, our dog continued vomiting and her weight kept dropping. So, we went to our primary vet and he recommended an Ultrasound which could only be done at our local Vet ER. Thankfully, the Ultrasound was negative. We now have our dog on a new food and are hoping this will be the answer. Currently, we've submitted 4 claims for our dog's current illness and all have been reimbursed. The process for submitting a claim to PetsBest couldn't be more easy.

Well, we did as your response to our original ""Pathetic"" review, we called your customer service.

They claimed it was denied because of our Bulldog  having ""Stenotic Nares"".   Hmmm, to correct Stenotic Nares the dog would have to have his nostrils widened via surgery.  Every Vet web site outlines this quite well. 

As previously noted in our original ""Pathetic"" review our dog needed a reduction in soft palate.  Below is taken from his ACTUAL MEDICAL RECORD ON THE ENCOUNTER DATE ...

Physical Exam:
5)  Respiratory:  Increased upper respiratory noise, elongated soft palate, MILDLY stenotic nares – no Nasal discharge tracheal palpitation unremarkable, pulmonary auscultation clear bilaterally with referred laryngeal sounds

Plan

Recommended palate resection

Hmm, don't see any mention of ""Stenotic Nare"" surgery... maybe because his assessment was MILDLY.  And, by the way, he did have a Palate resection.

Now we are waiting for you to send us your ""appeal"" form.  

I'm assuming you will be getting a ""Pathetic 3"" soon after.

62bcbb0dba5bb6ef04270e41,False,False,"Pets Best is no different than your typical human health plan. They offer limited coverage amounts for SOME needs, with categories quickly meeting their limit (even for a healthy pet!).
We're in the process of getting our 18-month-old Newfie spayed. I say ""in the process"" because when we brought her in on the day she was to have the procedure the vet ran pre-op blood work and determined she had a low platelet count. We postponed the operation until we could determine the cause. Suspecting it was Lyme, the vet tested. Negative. They ran a few other tests to determine the cause. While we waited a few days for the results, I submitted the claim to Pet's Best. Two weeks later they finally responded of the $300+ bill they covered $30. The items for which the vet billed us either weren't covered by our policy (we have both Best Wellness and BestBenefit plans), or we had reached the maximum allowable limit for the particular service. The allowable limits are laughably low ($70 for blood tests), so those get burned through pretty quickly. 
Like most insurance companies, Pet's Best uses that infuriating language that's unique to their industry. Co-pay, co-insurance, deductible, etc. This is maddening when you're just trying to get some help with your pet's well-being and you're stymied by what the documentation says. I'm convinced the real problem with healthcare in our country, be it for people or pets, isn't the providers. It's the insurance companies.
We're scheduled to have her spay done in about a month. We'll see if Pet's Best will pay out the whopping $150 they say they'll cover for a spay.

2) filed another claim for an injury, claim denied, resaon: old injury (2 TPLO surgeries to rear legs) that were not covered - they could not read ""Injury to front left leg"" - Had to appeal, took over 2 months in ""appeals"" for them to decide that the injury is covered.
3) they answer the phone, but can't give you any information.
4) Left word with to have supervisor call me regarding the "" lost claims""  and the denied claim - never returned calls.

Worst ever coverage - and you have to fight for every claim - which takes weeks.

626acb3c0c4813f76bf77ae2,False,False,"About 2 weeks ago, my 8-year-old Dane mix Abby was rushed to the emergency vet where she was diagnosed with a hemoabdomen bleed. Subsequently, she was transferred to an emergency hospital where she had surgery and stayed through the weekend. Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with cancer. Obviously, we are totally heartbroken over this development as she has been a happy and healthy girl up until this point. One comfort in this process is the knowledge that Pets Best is on our side. We enrolled her 2 years ago when she obviously had no health issues and I'm so glad we did. The tier of insurance we got for her means that after reimbursement, our out-of-pocket cost will be a very small fraction of the actual cost of her care. Knowing that made it so much easier for us to move forward with surgery and we'll continue on with chemotherapy; we just want as much time with our girl as possible as she is so sweet and precious to us. If we didn't have this insurance, I don't know how we could have covered the cost of her emergency care and surgery, much less ongoing treatment for her cancer. It breaks my heart to think we would have had to make a very different call due to our financial situation. I can wholeheartedly say that because of the wonderful doctors who cared for her and Pets Best, we are now lucky enough to have more time with our baby girl.

62674e140c4813f76bf49146,False,False,"Here's my feedback/review after 360 days using this pet insurance. 
If you're searching for pet insurance right now, like I was doing a year ago, Pets Best offered pretty comprehensive coverage for a dog older than 5 y/o. Unlimited annuals, 500 deductible (reasonable), 80% co-insurance - all for $60 a month(2021). I thought, ok, let's go with that. 
Half way through the year my dog had an illness I wanted to have checked. After roughly a month since I submitted a claim they, took that out of the deductible so I paid out of pocket - around $300.
A few months later another thing came up with my dog, minor accident playing at the park resulting in a paw injury. Went to the vet, had her patched up and then submitted the claim. Again, took forever and finally got a response that I had successfully reached the deductible. No reimbursement. By then I was out of a year's worth of insurance plus the out of pocket expense to go to the vet. No return yet. 
I figured since my renewal was coming soon, I would continue with them hoping that claims would be faster now that there was a history. 
All of a sudden, a letter comes in the mail. Premium goes up by $20 starting the new policy year. Now they want to charge $80 for the same amount of coverage. The reason: ""premiums in my area are up because of rising vet costs"". 

I was honestly giving them the most patience and trying my best to not have to go to another insurer. I tried to get a good answer as to why they would increase my premium by that much if none of the claims I submitted resulted in a pay out. I asked to reduce the premium but the best they could do was to offer to reduce coverage or increase the deductible. 
Closing thoughts: After a lot of research, I'm moving on to another policy. Pet insurance in general is a big scam and these companies are charging higher fees each year while also avoiding payouts with loopholes. Unfortunately this company missed the mark by jacking up the prices by a significant amount to loyal customers and to me, that means they are ok without my business. I've chosen a new policy and will be cancelling my PetsBest policy before it renews at the end of the month.",1,"Transparent, sensible review",0,,2022-04-26T03:42:44.223Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=95

However their claims process is very long and your first initial claims are handled poorly. Your claims are also handled depending on how competent the staff is which in my experience is a very minor few know what their doing.  I was told so many contradicting things by agents and made me extremely stressed and questioning why I bought this insurance. However through all the hassle and wait time I went through my claims were eventually approved. My pets medicine is also approved which is a big help. I'm concerned on where my rate is gonna go when my policy is up for renewal as I don't have full trust in this company with terms of that. I feel they might lure you in with a lower price to be stuck with a higher one later on yet I cannot speak to this yet but have heard stories that the rate increase was high. I want to note when signing up it was agreed to a 21 day processing time, but then changed to 39-45 days average time for processing. I'm not sure that is all that fair to the customer. I also made sure to provide all documentation needed for my pet from when adopted with all vet records on file and still had long processing times. When I spoke to an agent pets bets told me they didn't have this information and I had to resubmit all my documents, further taking away my trust. Again, All my claims have been approved so my rating is solely based on compensation and their plans. They have the  highest reimbursement limits, lowest deductible, and lowest annual cost. But processing time and customer service needs work, for transparency to customers and to gain faith their protected.

This second paragraph is as written after Petsbest’s response because trustpilot is a paid for application by business which doesn’t allow a thread conversation because its built to favor the client who is Pets Best. For that reason I continued editing my original post. Which is actually a response to pets best response below. I think it is very unfair to raise rates based on a dogs age which means you’re betting on him dying young. Why not simply have a base rate which you charge over the course of the dogs lifetime as it is not clear as to what rate you actually raise based on every subsequent year of a dogs life.

I had a quote in front of me for adding a second dog to my existing policy for $143, New dog $60.43 and existing dog $89.09.  I was concerned because I recognized that my current monthly cost for my existing dog was $172, so I chatted with support.  Shortly into my chat with the representative the rep is telling me that my price for my existing dog is showing $172 and a total of $230 for both dogs so I opened a second window and sure enough it was now showing this new price and $0 discount for multi dog.  I don't know what this rep did behind the scenes but I find this to be very sketch and concerning.  I screenshot both views... and then signed off on the lower price one.  Sure enough when I looked at my account information the price reflected was the $230.

The customer rep just chalked it up to the one quote was wrong and the other was right.  My concern is, imagine how I would have felt had I not noticed this and contacted support before accepting.  Would I have received the $143 price, did the rep do something behind the scenes to correct the quote once I reported the issue, I'll never know but I know had a month come and gone and I saw a draft on my bank account for nearly $100 more than what I approved I would have been pissed.

Next issue, Pets Best recently got a new underwriter with more favorable pricing.  However, existing customers can not take advantage of this without starting their policy over, meaning all grace periods are in effect and any pre-existing conditions are not covered - this means any condition that your pet may have been treated for under the prior policy would no longer be covered under the new policy because it's now pre-existing.

I encourage you all to shop around, find a pet insurance provider that is more honest and transparent.

I honestly don’t feel like it’s worth the price. Pets Best Health Insurance seems manipulative with their coverage. For instance, check ups don’t qualify for reimbursement like it’s stated unless it’s a complete diagnosis.

62180207ba48cd57a2a22d31,False,False,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Pets Best. I have never had pet insurance before- but after our two old pets passed away I knew I wanted to look into coverage. One had needed a monthly prescription and the other needed prescription food- both were incredibly costly. 

When we adopted a lab puppy, I decided accidents alone with that breed would be a given. I'm a researcher and I researched all my options for a week or two- you know- the spreadsheet type. 

I finally settled on Pets Best for several reasons:

1. When I called I was able to always promptly reach a person who was able to answer all of my questions.

2. As a former sales person, I can spot when someone is ""selling"" me from a mile away. Unlike some of the other consultants with other companies, I did not get that sense from my representative. If anything, they were able to help me weigh the pros and cons of their plan compared to the others I was considering.

3. The cost and coverage seemed the best balanced. 

Within a few months of adopting our dog, we adopted a cat. The dog ended up getting Lyme disease and the cat ended up developing a behavior disorder. Within just a few months of taking out our polices, we had already made our premiums back and then some. And we got a pro-rated discount when we added a second pet!

I cannot tell you what a relief it was when our dog got super sick, and the vet had to run a bunch of tests and then started talking about expensive treatment plans, just how nice it was to be solely focused on our dog, and not at all focused on the numbers. That in and of itself was such a gift. We didn't have to make any tough choices or consider ""wait and see""- we were able to just do what he needed to have done. 

If I had one complaint it would be that it can take a few months for the claims to be processed- but in the end, that's not a big deal. They may be a slow pay, but they pay. Filing a claim is super easy, there is always a human to speak with if needed, and their website and app are so easy and comprehensive that you rarely even need to speak with someone. 

I will never again not have pet Insurance and I am very pleased with Pets Best. They stand by what they say - no hoops to jump through, no hidden loopholes or ""catches"" to deny coverage. Just a straightforward and easy process.

61c26beb0430e828ebdad7bf,False,False,"I feel like PetsBest has changed radically since the pandemic. Claims are taking FOREVER to get reimbursed, or denied. My dogs juvenile cataracts were completely denied, with the explanation being that there weren’t enough records of her eye health? Who takes a 2 year old dog to an ophthalmologist just for the heck of it? There’s never a health issue until there is, and that’s when you take them to the vet, as I did. It’s a disingenuous way to avoid paying a valid claim and the surgery they probably feared was coming. For me it meant thousands out of pocket when I was already paying $200/month for 2 dogs (wellness included). Furthermore, the last rate increase was horrendous-a near 50% increase for same coverage. Up to $276/month. That’s absurd if they’re just going to deny claims anyway. The last one to be denied was an ordinary bill for vaccines from a vaccine clinic. PB didn’t like the format of the invoice apparently. I mean COME ON. Lastly, when I called about the rate increase the customer service was flat-out rude. Check recent BBB activity on this company. NOT what it used to be. They’ll pay for random illnesses, accidents etc., but beware if your pet has anything that might become chronic or expensive. They’ll deny the condition up front to get out of paying for it long-term. You know-the stuff people buy insurance for. Been paying them thousands each year for years and years without any significant claims? THEY DO NOT CARE. And once you’re signed up, you’re stuck. I’m now paying $90/month for a 6 year old mixed breed who’s never had anything wrong but one tooth problem. But any other pet insurance company will now categorize any dental as preexisting, so I’m loathe to switch. I’ve come to feel PB adjustors and leadership are crooks, liars and thieves. If you have a young pet, start them elsewhere. PB is riding on its old reputation while adopting shady insurance biz practices and jacking rates to unmanageable levels each year. For what they charge I can get the same coverage plus alternative therapies at two other companies who’s staff aren’t rude.",1,PetsBest is no longer the best or even close.

Going into my next annual plan, my premium is so high that I will receive almost nothing in claims ie premium is $9600/yr with a max claim of $15K per year. My premium is going up $200/mo for the new year. If I had known that they were going to price me out of the plan just when my dogs are old enough to need it, I never would have started with them.

For your average pet owner, pet insurance is something we expect to cover repetitive expenses: dental cleanings, shots, physicals, fecal floatation, anal gland expression, etc. Most of that is covered but only if you buy the Best Wellness plan, and even then, the maximum payout per period is so low and so specific that most routine care isn't actually covered. For example, the dental cleaning is ""fully"" covered, but that just means the dental prophylaxis is covered, not medical waste, anesthesia, ampicillin, vitals monitoring, dental radiographs, endotracheal intubation, IV catheter/fluids, Hospitalization, dental exam, or bloodwork. All together, our total bill is just over $900. PetsBest reimbursed us $270.

For accident and illness, the plan is great. We have the 90% reimbursement and $250 out of pocket.

I have full faith in what they do, that my money is going to a good cause, and that they fulfill their roles as an insurance provider.

We took our 8-year-old shepherd mix to the Vet for a routine check-up. To our shock, he felt a lump on her thyroid gland that turned out to be cancerous. Our Jolie was a beloved ​member of our family and we would never fail to do anything we could to save and prolong her life. We are not a wealthy family, but can afford to spend a few thousand dollars to save our dog. Anymore would create a financial hardship, but I know for sure we would have not let that stop us from trying. We were blessed with the fact that a year prior, I decided to purchase Pet Insurance with Pets Best. After taking Jolie to Texas A&M Animal Hospital for treatment for Thyroid Cancer, they discovered a heart mass. To make a long story short, in a period of a few months both Thyroids were removed, open heart surgery, 20 days of radiation and five days of Chemo. The first bill from Texas A&M was for over 10 thousand dollars. I never hesitated to proceed,  even though we had to pay upfront. We summited our claim to Pet's Best. I have to admit I was not sure how legit pet insurance was, as having never insured any of my dogs before. As stated in my policy they would have to investigate back many months to make sure Jolie had not been diagnosed or suspected of Cancer. Did they pay? We spent over 40 days at Texas A&M over a period of two and a half years, and she remained Cancer free. On May of this year she was diagnosed with a disease of the spine. After several tests to determine if surgery or any treatment would help Jolie....the answer was NO. By July she had fought her Final Battle. It is with tears in my eyes I write her story and I have always considered myself a tough guy. I have to Thank Pets Best for staying with us to the end. They may take a little longer to pay than you feel necessary, but pay they will. Jolie's medical bills were somewhere north of 30 thousand dollars and yes, they paid the lion's share of these bills.

With this noose they know we can't leave and have our fur babies fully covered so they put the premiums and monthly charges up so ridiculously high most people can't afford the cost therefore the customer either has to lower coverage to lower the cost of coverage or cancel it all together.
Clever stuff on their part i say.
That being said they do pay out when needed but it comes to a point that after a year of paying extortionate monthly payments and the premiums for each animal in the end is the coverage worth it.
When your fur baby is young and healthy its cheap.

6131168c9c391649d850a1b6,False,False,"UPDATE TO MY REVIEW:
I got a message back basically telling me what I was told before....I will have to rewrite the policy if I want office exams included in the one that does not now.  Doing that would me I need to do all the wait times again... MY ONE QUESTION is WHY if I have 3 BestBenefit plans for 3 dogs is office exams included on 2 and not all.  I DID NOT SELECT THIS! I would like to talk to someone but apparently I can't.  Again,  I do not think this is good customer service.  


I previously wrote a review and have had a couple days to think about it.  I decided I would write exactly why I wrote the 1 star review hoping a supervisor or manager will see it and maybe I can get some help. 
I have 3 pets, all on the BestBenefit plan.  While reviewing the renewal declarations page I noticed that only one of my dogs officevists/exam fees were not covered.  I called and questioned this and after speaking with one rep.  she also agreed that there was no way of me selecting that and she was going to talk to a manager and get back to me.  When I didn't receive the call (although I was told they did call and leave a message on my cell...there was no missed calls or messages at all... ok figured they called the wrong number.  So this rep said they could not change this unless I rewrote the policy and had the same waiting periods etc.  I was not happy with that as I felt it could be changed by someone in management.  I asked to speak to a manager and she put me on hold,  came back after a few minutes and stated that the manager reiterated that I had to rewrite the policy.  I then asked again if I could speak to a manager and was told "" No,  I already did and this what she told me to tell you.""  I really think this is poor customer service but as I previously stated because of the age of 2 of my dogs I cannot look elsewhere for a new insurance or rewrite the policy.  Although this insurance is affordable I guess it's true...""You get what you pay for.""",1,update on my 1 star review,0,,2021-09-02T18:23:08.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=121

The lymphoma under my dogs chin was the reason the my pups claim was denied and I was told that this was a pre-existing condition and the bills totaling roughly $1200, none of would be covered. 

I then had to go down the extremely lengthy process of appealing each claim individually, getting a formal letter written by my vet stating it was not pre-existing, providing the biopsy notes from the lab that determined what type of mass cell tumor my pup had and writing a timetable for them to follow as the event happened. The appeal process took so long (Note: I provided all of the above requested information to them within a two weeks timeframe) that the 90 day follow up I had scheduled with a specialist to make sure the tumor was not popping back up was also denied because of the “pre-existing condition” that I was already appealing. I then had to open up ANOTHER appeal claim for the specialist visit. It took roughly 4 months all in all the finally get the reimbursement from Pets Best. The worst part is, is that I am now stuck with the company because if I were to go to a new insurance provider, EVERYTHING would be a pre-existing condition and at that point, I should not even have insurance at all.

This business feels like a giant fraud, as did my experiences with the business that owns this business. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. There is a chance that all pet insurances work like that since this is the only one I tried but the market should clearly wipe this one out in favor of more competent ones. 


By the way, their website claims 'fast 5 day claims processing'. Check the reviews, the lie detector found that was a lie. It also claims not to raise the price of the policy because you filed a claim. How is raising mine then every year 30% and sends me an email that age is the reason?",1,Here are the facts,1,,2021-08-07T06:11:56.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=123

60bdb293f9f4870a94b7ec47,False,False,"So far, I am very pleased with Pets Best. The claims process is easy (literally you go online and upload a picture of your receipt,) everything I have expected to be covered has been, the Explanation of Benefits breakdown they send is easy to understand, and I find their premium/deductible very reasonable. 

I have been a veterinary technician for over 16 years and have researched and worked with MANY pet insurance companies over those years. When I got my new puppy last year I knew I was going to get her insurance but it took A LOT to decide on a company (I literally spent HOURS getting quotes and reading policies and fine prints). I finally decided on Pets Best for a number of reasons, including: their premium is reasonable especially for unlimited coverage which is an amazing piece of mind for a worrier like me and (a big one) their premium increase with age was the least drastic compared to other companies. I know if my pet ever develops an issue, that that issue will now be a preexisting condition if I ever switched insurance companies, I wanted to find a company I could stay with long term and be able to afford the coverage. Also, if my premium does get too high as she gets older I can downgrade my coverage or increase my copay to lower my rate and I will not need a 'new policy.' 

The veterinary industry is VERY busy right now resulting in many people submitting a lot of claims.  That being said, you WILL have a long wait for your claims. People seem to bash the company for taking a long time to process claims and not covering pre-existing conditions, that is how pet insurance works. My claims on average have taken about a month (only 2.5 weeks for my last one though). People don't seem to understand pet insurance DOES NOT cover preexisting conditions, so if your dog just ruptured its cruciate ligament and you think getting insurance will pay for you to fix the problem, it won't. If you're mad Pets Best's 'customer service doesn't care and claims take too long to get your money, so you're going elsewhere,' just be aware if you've submitted claims your pet likely has a problem and now that's a preexisting condition that will not be covered at this 'new insurance' you're switching too.
 
Pet insurance is an amazing peace of mind for those who want to know that in the event of a FUTURE problem, you are covered. I know if anything happens I can do EVERYTHING to save/help my pet and will not have to worry about costs in the end, totally worth it for me!",5,"So far, very pleased with my experiences",0,,2021-06-07T05:45:55.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=128

They claim I have to take up ""pre-existing"" issues with my vet? HA!! Since when is an emergency condition pre-existing? And secondly, this was the very first visit to the vet..so what BS are they trying to get away with? I guess that's their way of worming out of coverage. Using the bogus excuse that things are pre-existing. Don't believe them folks. 
Original Review: I had high hopes for this insurance coverage for our little 14 yr Elvis. I opted for the highest 90% coverage and even added the wellness coverage. Unfortunately, after one visit to the vet for a sudden illness, an approximately $750 bill paid out to the vet, was reimbursed by the insurance for only $59. They back charged so called co-pays (not specified in the plan docs) and also claimed that some of the medication given was for a ""pre-existing condition"" prior to the date of coverage. Absolute BS!!! Save your money, put it in the bank and use that to pay your vet bills. I shelled out almost $1200 for what I believed to be very good coverage for my kitty only to be slapped in the face. They can keep their stickin $59.",1,Save Your Money.

Let me make it clear that each time he went to any veterinarian anywhere we were, it was for a different reason. The fact that they can group all the visits together and claim a pre-existing condition is fraudulent. None of the symptoms were the same. None of the reasons I took him to the vet were for the same thing. This company IS NOT a good choice!  If you love your pet PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS INSURANCE. You will be sorry!

609c8b50f9f4870a94a0a688,False,False,"They used to have a great reputation, but idk what happened. 

I went with pets best because of the price and wellness plans etc. I currently have 5 outstanding claims with them and nothing. Full disclosure, they range from one calendar month to one week ago. However, they’re all marked as “received” or “waiting for vet info” despite attaching the full vet notes on letterhead with detail…. My vets office has confirmed that they haven’t even contacted them btw. I keep getting “sorry we’re taking so long” automated updates and they claim they’re hiring more staff. The bbb “resolution” about this has not been updated since March of last year. 

Also, their “direct pay” is misleading…. Unless your vet will take payment plans/arrangements, it’s just a paper. That your vet agrees to receive payment from them directly. Well that’s great…. But no vet will keep you or continue this if they’re taking 35-40 (business) days to process claims. You also need a prior approval for anything over 1k, so hopefully if you have an expensive emergency….. your animal won’t mind waiting 30-40 days. Otherwise I guess they’ll deny the claim for not having pre approval. 

Pros: affordability for young animals, optional wellness plan, uh…. Handy app (like everyone else)

Con: you will not receive payment any time soon, they have terrible customer service. So if you have a line of credit/payment option/interest free plan and can afford to wait almost two calendar months for your claim to be reviewed, it’s great.

I had Pets Best for close to a year, submitted one claim and was denied, and never communicated when it was or why. I had to call back myself many times to get an answer. Their entire business model is setup around it being difficult for you to get ahold of them and submit claims. Their user experience is so bad on purpose they want you to give up and forget about claims. My dog had some neuro issues with his back legs. The vet wanted to do an MRI to rule out a genetic disease, which they tested for but were waiting the results back. He was in pain so they wanted to do the MRI as soon as possible. Pets Best took weeks to even get a pre authorization form in for the MRI. I couldn't wait any longer and got the MRI myself which was expensive. The results came back and all he had was virus you can get from local lakes, and all he needed was some antibiotics. I called pets best back to get let them know I didn't need the Pre Authorization anymore. They had already closed it deeming it Pre Existing and they wouldn't cover. Once I mentioned to them it wasn't that it was a virus they said I would need to resend all the claims again but it won't be covered anyways because that can also be considered pre existing with a boxer breed. WHAT?! If the Pre-Authorization for the MRI had been covered I could have had this paid for and handled right away. As it was deemed not the genetic disease rather a common virus in puddle/lake water. Instead Pets Best did not help me in a time of crisis, like an insurance company should! Please do not give them your time or money. They need to re-brand to Pets Worst!

Here are my experiences and reasons to not go with this insurance:
- They give you quite the runaround to submit claims. They never tell you if you are missing anything or need something else. You need to call back yourself to find out the status.
- The wait time on the phone is crazzzzy! Each time I called I was on hold for an 1hr plus. One time equalling 2.5 hr phone call. What!! My dog was in a bit of an emergency or I would never wait that long. 
- They will claim almost anything a ""Pre-existing condition""
- They will not pre-authorize in a time of crisis if you need it. The runaround for this is insane and expect to send in tons and tons of documents with no response or updates. 
- Once you get ahold of a real person they are not able to answer your questions. There is a disconnect between them and the people actually approving claims. They seem to be just a phone answering service. 

Hope this helps the next person considering them. Definitely do not! Find a good insurance that actually cares for your pets needs, they are hard to find, but this one does not no matter how much their marketing team claims they do!

My dog presented with lameness during the waiting period, and it was unclear to me and my veterinarian what the cause was. The diagnosis was unclear, but it was suspected to be an injury based on the X-Ray. About three months after the waiting period ended, my dog was diagnosed with osteosarcoma (bone cancer) and was recommended to undergo chemotherapy and an amputation of the diseased limb, which would have given her another year of life as opposed to two months (without treatment). I thought to myself, “thank goodness I purchased pet insurance!” Actually, I have no one to thank and definitely NOT Pets Best. Pets Best settled that the cancer was linked to the lameness that presented a few months prior during the waiting period, so they labeled the cancer as a pre-existing condition, even though my veterinarian records revealed NO EVIDENCE of a cancer diagnosis BEFORE or DURING the policy waiting period. Pets Best even had my veterinarian records to prove that there was no evidence of a pre-existing cancer diagnosis. Therefore, I would have been stuck paying for all medical costs IN FULL. The limb amputation alone would have cost me $1,000-$2,000 and chemotherapy would have been $400 per session. My dog needed at least weekly chemotherapy which meant that I would be paying, out-of-pocket, $1,600 per month, or $19,200 PER YEAR, JUST FOR THE CHEMOTHERAPY. That is half of my net salary! I am a mental health professional working in the non-profit sector, so this is a HUGE burden on my heart and my finances. I had to make the heart-wrenching decision to euthanize my beautiful dog because I could not afford her care. Pets Best discriminated against my dog without full consideration. My dog had a healthy medical record with NO EVIDENCE of pre-existing conditions, and they had the veterinary records to prove it. Based on Pets Best treatment of me and my pet, I don’t believe that Pets Best cares about the well-being of their customers and their pets. It’s clear to me that Pets Best will find any way that they can to NOT pay for your pet’s medical treatments by prejudicially asserting that any presenting accidents/illnesses were due to a pre-existing condition. I have lost trust in Pets Best and will NOT insure with them, ever again, and will NOT recommend them.

P.S. Thank you for your reply. Pets Best had my dog's veterinary records that proved that there was not a history of cancer issues in my dog. Therefore, it was NOT pre-existing.",1,Unfair Judgement of Pre-Existing Conditions,1,,2021-04-28T02:30:34.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=133

They also didn't reimburse me the full amount for a wellness plan on my other dog and made a mistake, I had to keep calling and calling and calling I finally got ahold of someone and they said oh it looks like we made a mistake, I will submit an appeal for you.

They refused to pay for my claim because they state that a symptom which hadn't had a diagnosis because no vet had come up with one was considered pre-existing.

So basically if the dog sneezes and you take them to a vet then later do a claim for that visit they refuse to pay for the claim stating to me that the symptom is pre-existing!  

Also takes them close to 45 minutes to get a rep on the phone.  They also made me send them a bunch of vet notes called SOAP to be denied later because in my case the vet was still trying to figure out what was wrong with my dog and why she was getting diarrhea.  It honestly seemed from the many request for the same notes and x-rays that they were digging to try and find an excuse not to pay for the claim.  

Stay far, far, away from this company get Nationwide pet insurance instead at least they pay the claims and not make you feel like if you're trying to take advantage of them.  Yeah the representative I spoke with made me feel like if I was trying to rip them off!  I have never been so ill treated by a company like this one.

Hope this helps someone never pay them one red cent they are truly the definition of horrendous service!

The reply from the insurance company below is a complete lie!  No where on the medical notes from the vet does it say that she had a pre existing condition let me know if I should send screen shots of these notes which they already have but won’t show anyone a copy of course!

Also, take note how they are not even offering to contact me to fix this situation if they were being honest then contact me and tell me where the hell it says that the condition of my dog was pre existing!

6036b746f85d750b989fcaa8,False,False,"Overall I think it's a good insurance for Illnesses and Accidents.
Except they really wanna find something in the past so that it can be taken as ""pre-existing"" condition. My dog has been to a dermatologist before we start the insurance and tested by pricking the skin. He showed allergies against dust, cat dander, some types of grass. Doctor reported as Atopic Dermatitis. Being said he had an ear infection and they didn't wanna cover it because the dermatologist report. Even though my dog's own vet don't believe it should be related, but Pets Best did.  Also he gets staph infections he won't get covered, why? Because of atopic dermatitis he might be more prone to get staph infection. Not to mention they covered his cytology tests twice before but then stopped covering it.

I also don't recommend their Wellness plan, If you live in an urban big city. Your bill is higher and the coverage is worthless as in whatever discount they offer in the plan. It's literally the total sum of your year long premiums. 

Other than that they are good. I do recommend them. If you get your pets insured as they are puppies you won't come close with any bumps on the road with them.

As an example: the claim for the histopathology exam - to diagnose which kind of oral cancer my cat had - was denied due to a ""pre-existing condition""!!!!!!!! He was never diagnosed with cancer before and if he had had oral squamous cell carcinoma at the time I got the insurance for him, he would have been dead long ago.

Are they waiting to get $150 worth in premium payments from me first? They should have worked on the first claim.

** UPDATE: I found out that my claim for a wellness dental cleaning was processed as an “undiagnosed illness-acute.” When I asked why is a dental cleaning considered an “undiagnosed illness”? They said there was an extraction. Meaning they’ll deny the claim because there was one extraction. That extraction will be considered a pre-existing condition, which means they’ll deny my claim. Do you see how they get you?! These are the little clauses that are not mentioned in their policy when people are signing up for insurance. People beware!!! This company is notorious for denying claims by using the “pre-existing” excuse. Stay away from PetsBest! I canceled before they take any more money from me!

5ff3f494755dc107e0d74029,False,False,"I thought Pet Insurance would be a good idea after I had to pay $6K for one of my three dogs to have his Gall Bladder removed, so I investigated pet insurance and I chose Pets Best partly because they would cover my 14-year-old schnoodle and partly because their prices were good for the coverage. I paid the premiums for about a year for my three dogs which amounted to about a $1K. I felt good thinking I would be covered if he needed any big expensive surgeries. My schnoodle suddenly got sick and was dying, and I took him to the emergency vet and sure enough they said he needed his Gall Bladder removed. I said go ahead thinking I was covered. Well I was SO relieved that my little dog made it through the surgery and recovered and the bill came to over $6K again. I turned this claim along with 12 other smaller claims thinking I would at least be partially reimbursed for the expenses. It took Pets Best about 40 days to finally settle the claims and I spent hours submitting the claims and resubmitting them every few days. I started looking through the claims, and they didn't pay me one cent for any of my claims. Let me warn you Pet Insurance is NOT like our medical insurance it is a ""scam"". They have loopholes to get out of paying almost any claim you can think of because they exclude pre-existing conditions. If you think about it almost every dog or cat over 10 years of age is going to have a pre-existing condition. Only young dogs are not going to have a pre-existing condition, and then they are probably not going to have any medical problems anyway. The only way they can't weasel out of paying a claim is if your dog swallows a bone, gets hit by a car or jumps off a table and breaks his leg. In other words a freak accident that is not likely to happen like an illness. They ask your veterinarian to send in medical records, but it is not YOUR vet that makes the decision if the condition was pre-existing it is their vets so guess what they are going to decide! Everything CAN be considered pre-existing. Having this Pets Best insurance caused me a lot of stress, and it was a big relief when I cancelled it because I know that unless my dog swallows a ball or gets run over I am never going to get any money out of Pets Best. Save your money and put it in a savings account for your dogs medical expenses because pet insurance is not ready for prime time. With our insurance Obama Care made it illegal to not cover pre-existing conditions but with pet insurance they use this exclusion to get out paying 95% of the claims they receive. Also, Pets Best is next to impossible to get in touch with by phone or email, and they never answer your emails. It is a shame that they are allowed to continue in business with all the complaints against them. I am an honest person and this review is exactly what happened to me. Luckily I only had Pets Best for a year so I didn't lose thousands of dollars in premiums so please reconsider if you are considering pet insurance. You WILL be sorry as I was. Pets Best is making a big mistake denying EVERY claim. If they had at least paid a couple of my claims I wouldn't have cancelled them. They should learn from the gambling industry. You have to let the people win some time, or they will quit gambling, and you will lose all the people that are paying insurance premiums, and you will be out of business.

5fe3ba91755dc1032c01e7e2,False,False,"READ YOUR POLICY. Insurance is a scam. They hook you with lower prices and empty promises. I put insurance on my dog when she was 3 months old. Fast forward to 3 months later, my 6 month old puppy tore her cruciate ligament. I was fully aware of the injury and illness waiting period and fully expected her injury to fall under injury coverage I had purchased. It was specifically spelled out on my Policy Application under ""Your Pets Coverage Begins: Illness: 14 days [...], Accident: 3 days [...]."" After waiting 42 days for them to process my claim, it came back rejected. Thats when I found out about the 6 month waiting period for cruciate tears. After calling customer service it was described to me as ""an anomaly"" that she even tore her cruciate at 6 months of age. Despite it being an anomaly, it can not/will not be covered because it happened before my waiting period. I argued although I havent held the policy for 6 months it should be covered based on the fact that I was a responsible pet owner and purchased insurance as soon as I could for her. Despite my efforts to work with PetsBest they rejected coverage because the injury occurred before my waiting period was up. Footing me with a $6,000 surgery scheduled for the 28th and my monthly insurance payments that have not caused me any financial relief. If they cared about pets and prided themselves on their coverage they would have a heart to work with me and make things right in this rather unusual and rare situation. I fully recommend not purchasing a policy from them. Do not let their low prices hook you like they did to me. I have done some more research and came to the conclusion ""Pumpkin"" is a better option. They are more expensive, but from what I have seen all of their waiting periods are shorter and they have less things excluded.",1,Do NOT buy PetsBest Insurance,0,,2020-12-23T21:45:53.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=143

5fdeba8c755dc10b4828be31,False,False,"One understands that a 20% copay kicks in once the deductible has been reached.  I.e., for a $1300 vet bill with a $1000 deductible and 20% copay, the insurance payout should be:  
(1300-1000) x 0.8 = $240.  

Not by PetsBest math.  

PetsBest applies that copay to the entire bill.  I.e., the customer pays the deductible AND an additional 20% on those deductible dollars.  So in the above example the payout is:
((1300 x 0.8) -1000) x 0.8) = $32.  

In effect, this makes the copay $1250 as not a single payment will be made before (vet bill x 0.8) > $1000.  

Hard to believe, but true.  This was our actual calculated experience.  

Nowhere on the website is this unusual calculation and interpretation of copay/deductible explained.  We are not renewing our policy after this year and strongly recommend against others falling victim to PetsBest math.",1,PetsBest math is deceptive,0,,2020-12-20T02:44:28.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=144
5fde6188755dc10b48289aba,False,False,"I'm not exaggerating when I say that Pets Best is hands-down the WORST company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. After several claims, I have NEVER had a SINGLE claim resolved without an astonishing level of incompetence and significant commitment of my time and effort to resolve. Pets Best has a strategy of deliberate negligence and incompetence that is designed to dodge their responsibilities and discourage customers from pursuing legitimate claims. 

Here are some examples of the kinds of experiences you can expect from Pets Best:
*Mixing up the details of claims that were submitted separately, and being unable to separate them again, leading to a chain of subsequent mistakes, lost threads and erroneously closing claims without payment
*Losing claims
*Not responding to claims in the period of time required by state insurance regulations nor the timeframes set out in PetsBest's own documents
*Strict refusal to put anything in writing when explicitly requested
*Refusing to tell customers what documentation is needed to resolve a claim to make it easier to decline payment
*Giving different information in writing than what was unambiguously stated on the phone
*Not responding to requests for additional information
*Multiple other practices that qualify as acting in bad faith according to California insurance regulations

Here is just one of many stories that give you a sense of how this company operates: Six weeks after submitting a claim (PB promises claims take 15-30 days to process), I received an email notifying me that Pets Best was having trouble reaching my vet for medical records. I called my vet (a small practice with only 2 doctors and an office manager), and found out that the office person was on vacation. I made arrangements to call back, and didn't notify PB of the steps taken because I know from experience that they don't read their emails and the phone queue is in excess of 1 hour. A little over a week later, ON THANKSGIVING DAY, I got another email from PB again requesting my assistance in reaching my vet. I responded the same day with a description of the steps I'd taken, the reason for the delay, and when they could expect a response. The following night (i.e. the Friday after Thanksgiving) at 9:58pm Pacific time, I got notification from PetsBest that they had closed the case and wouldn't be honoring my claim on the grounds of lack of response. I called them first thing Monday (by which time I had the documentation they needed), and it took 90 minutes on hold plus another hour on the phone to get them to reopen the case. Then it took them more than two weeks (more time than they gave me) and a threat of legal action to get them to approve the claim. Every single claim I have submitted has met with similar levels of incompetence, poor business practices and negligence. The people on the phone are sweet as pie and slick as used car salesmen.

I would NOT recommend PetsBest to anyone under any circumstances. Pass it on.

Edit: In response to the the comment below - You expect me to share personal info over the public internet?! Are you joking? Do you want my SSN and mother’s maiden name too? Boneheaded judgement and lack of common sense like this is what leads you to be such an ineffective company that can’t solve basic administrative problems.

It's Nov 23rd and they said they still have no decision and we likely wont even get paid close to what should be covered. Not even 2 weeks later our vet gives us a prescription to treat our puppy's stomach illness and PetsBest denies the claim saying it was ""preventative"" so we had to submit an appeal and have our vet manually write that the medicine was used to treat our puppy rather than prevent.

My cat suddenly came down with Chronic Kidney Disease and the course of discovery and treatment cost a fortune. The only thing that made me feel like I was able to take the steps to take care of him and get him well again was that I had insurance.

The Pets Best site made it easy for me to upload what felt like an endless stream of bills and invoices onto the site for approval and after the approval process I was given clear breakdowns of what was being covered. It saved my finances and my cats life knowing that I had this support.

I have watched many of my friends and family forced to put a price cap on the care of their pets when I know they would have preferred otherwise and I completely understand that pain, but it was a huge relief to know that there would be some support to get me though those expenses.

I have recommended insurance to everyone I know who has a pet and I will continue to do so and advocate for the amazing support I received from Pets Best.

But when it comes to customer service and waiting to see if something is covered, or trying to speak to a person on the phone I would rate it a negative 1 star if I could. When you call Pets Best, just plan on getting in a workout or watch a movie and keep it on speaker phone because you will be waiting a very long time on hold listening to ""elevator music"". They will take about a month or longer to process your claim even though you did everything electronically and sent veterinarian invoices in right away, it doesn't matter. Just one example, I sent in all the necessary bills and documentation from my dogs surgery on September 29, 2020 and the next day it showed Pets Best receiving the claim. I just received my reimbursement from them on November 3, 2020. I couldn't even blame it on ""snail mail"" because everything is set up electronically for ""faster and more convenient service"" Also Pets Best advertises a ""more convenient "" pay directly to your veterinarian . This is a joke, nothing simple or convenient about it. I tried with my vet and it was such a big hassle that I had to cancel the process and pay the bill myself and wait the 35 days for reimbursement . My vet did everything they had to do, not only faxing the bill directly to Pets Best, but also calling Pets Best about payment. When my vet was told payment to them could be at least 30 days or more, they were not too happy with that and told me that my bill would remain as outstanding and charged interest if not payed in 30 days. So I didn't take the chance and paid my bill in full and waited the 30 plus days for my reimbursement. Anyhow, when all said Pet Insurance is the way to go and it will save you money in the long run.

I got pets best when I got my kitten in July. 
I called and they told me the insurance is active and I can start going to vets. I took him in for vaccines. It ended up being not covered because I gotta wait 7 days before I can visit vets. 

Then the month after I took him in for another vaccine because he's only 6 weeks old he had 3 vaccines planed. Nothing was covered again except for $20 out of my $300 bill. 

And then they said my vaccine claimable amount has reached its limit even tho the plan I bought for $40 a month is supposed to not have a limit. Oh also, $40 a month they don't cover accidents or illness, or examination fees, or pretty much anything.  It's literally more expensive than any of the top 10 pet insurance you can find on review sites. I only got them because I thought Progressive was a large reputable company so maybe their pet insurance is good. NOPE!

They cover nothing, and when I asks for refund they said they can give me a pro-rated refund, meaning they'll refund me the money they haven't charged me yet for the month after if I had cancel before my next payment. What a huge scam!!!

I pay rough 400$ a quarter for my pets (2 dogs under 3yrs old, no known health issues) insurance plans. I chose low deductible plans with the highest coverage that Pets Best offers. It's pricey but worth it. The problems come when you actually try to use the plans. You pay your vet bill upfront and then submit them for reimbursement. Every single time I have done this over the last 2 years, it has taken them almost two months to reimburse me. Recently I submitted a bill from a sick visit for my puppy that totaled roughly 350$. It has been over 4 weeks, and I still have not received any correspondence regarding the claim except that it has been received. However in that 4 week period my premium became due so I ended up shelling out another $400 to Pets Best, even though they owe me $315 from the claim. When I call to inquire about the claim I am told that they are understaffed due to the pandemic. This may be the case now, but this delay was happening well before the pandemic hit.

5f60ba8802e8570a4872a1fc,False,False,"I got this policy, because of other great reviews and compared to other insurances, it seemed like they had the least wait period and had no lifetime limits. I paid $599 & some change for a 6-MONTH policy. My dog needed extraction for an abscess, which cost $692. With pet insurances, you pay UP FRONT COSTS directly to the vet and then I guess IF your claim gets APPROVED, after paying your deductible on top of what you’ve already paid for the policy, you will get some reimbursement (which most likely will not cover all the extra bs miscellaneous costs that vets charge.)  HOWEVER, the disclaimer comes with a long list and the statement IF IT GETS APPROVED. If I had money to pay up front, there is NO REASON for me to NEED this insurance!! 
I also know it’s the pandemic, so they took about a month to tell me my claim was DENIED. Their reason is that my dog needed cleaning for at least 13 MONTHS, but even the website says they don’t cover pre-existing conditions & periodontal disease. I’m not sure about anywhere else but in the state of FL, the biggest issue in pets is periodontal disease. Long story short, they PROVED to me that insurances are SCAMS. A guy recently posted that because his dog had a preexisting condition & fell, it wasn’t covered either. I’m really NOT sure why I pay insurances for. If I just saved the money I paid into it, I would never need them. I think all insurances just want our money but they really don’t want us to use them. That’s how they profit. It’s sad that pets are being profitted too and it’s even more sad that animals get abused, abandoned, & euthanized simply because they can’t afford expensive vet bills and insurances they can’t use. I recommend saving your money for emergency funds, visit non-profit vet hospitals instead of wasting it on unnecessary insurance that you can’t use when you need it. Believe me, I don’t want to use it and I hope to never need it, but to deny conditions that you know is prevalent in these animals is really “clever.” Bottom line: DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY & TIME, because insurances are a SCAM. They don’t really want you to use it. Sadly, they do not care about your pets; they just want your money like the rest of insurance companies.",1,Do NOT waste your time & money!

5f4674a102e85708c8d954b0,False,False,"Submitting claims and signing up is very easy and before the last two months, I would've recommended them wholeheartedly. But the entire purpose of having pet insurance is to have a way to pay and be reimbursed for unexpected vet bills in a timely manner. The service has declined so much that now it's over a month to them to pay emergency claims. I noticed that normal wellness claims are still paid quickly but emergency claims are taking a month or more to process. They send out a generic email saying they are sorry (I've received it twice but no payment). If you contact support, they are not going to give you any answers about where you are in the queue and will tell you that the wait time has extended from your original estimate. No estimate of when your specific claim will be dealt with, all canned responses not specific to you. I absolutely understand covid has  made things slower than normal,which is why I waited a month to even check on the claims. But this has been happening since May and it's end of August now. Since I have had a chronic condition with my pet, I've had to submit around 7 claims over the last few months.

5f35c4d69cc22a0600cb5aae,False,False,"INTRO:

I try to never write negative reviews, but this just has to be presented at least so they can make some changes, if possible. I can’t give too low of a rating because I have had good experiences overall, but in this new year it’s really been tough for me to see any of the prior positives.   

BACKGROUND:

I’ve been paying this insurance for a few years now, and honestly it was great. I didn’t file many claims, if any really, and the ones I did file got handled well. In truth, I spent more on the premium then I spent at the Vet. But that’s how it is with insurance sometimes; so no harm no foul.

MIXED EXPERIENCE: 

Until this year, when our pup got sick. Calling for a rep takes over an hour every time! If you don’t believe it you can literally just call the line yourself. Walk away for 10 min and for the most part expect to hear the elevator music still playing when you get back. I get it, a lot of places are short staffed, but that just means treating your customers in a positive manner and making them feel like they matter when you are able to finally get to them. Needless to say my claims kept getting closed (denied) simply because they say they can’t read it. Decided to get more documentation from the Vet, and walked a representative through everything. A few weeks later checked and it was closed again specifying inability to read. How is that possible when we spoke and everything was agreed upon?!

Called them back again to ask about this and literally, in oh so many words, got told “go figure it out it’s not on us”. Wow. I’m not sure what was happening with the rep that day, but waiting for a rep for an hour and to be talked to in such a manner was horrendous! Asked to speak to a supervisor and was told in many words, “Yeah, sure someone might call you in a few days, need anything else?” Another WOW! Also, never did get that call back, so I gave it another shot and got a rep that truly was positive and I really appreciate her assistance, and also putting in a note about my last experience. I hope we can get back to a good place.

MOBILE APP:

The mobile app is basically a browser, maybe? It’s not the most intuitive, but it’s functional so it’s whatever. 

FINAL THOUGHTS:

May be worth a try, but be very wary of the things that were outlined in my experience since it seems that it is a reoccurring theme with a few of the negative reviews.


 Also, I did enjoy my experience with two reps Penny and Shea. I hope they are well taken care of! They are assets to the company.",3,Some truths that I’ve experienced,0,,2020-08-13T22:55:18.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=153

Just in case, I requested the vet to submit it again. Then, I called Pets Best to ask about my claim, waited for almost an hour, and was still not connected to an agent. So then, I decided to use the internet chat option in hope for a faster response.  I still had to wait 45 minutes before finally being connected to an agent. The agent told me that it will take up to 25 days to complete the claim and advised me to call back by the end of July.  
Today is August 4th, 2020, I checked my claim status again and it still showed ""waiting on vet info"".

Pets Best is very responsive, the payment on claims is quick and it is SO easy to submit a claim. I use two other pet insurance companies and submitting claims is so much more complicated and barely anything is covered so I have to appeal and bring in my veterinarian to justify the cause. Pets Best always explains, in easy to understand language, what was covered and what wasn't...and why. 
Also, I used the petline number when I had a sick kitty. It was great! The vet tech was knowledgable and a vet even called to follow up.
Having this insurance has eased a lot of emotional stress because I know that I can afford to take care of my diabetic cat who also has a heart arrhythmia. I don't know what I would have done without it...I don't even want to think about it.

This company has denied all but one claim by trying to say it was a preexisting condition. They will label ANYTHING they can as a preexisting condition just so they won't pay it. They literally told me ""A lot of people get denied.""

The first claim they denied is because they said that ""the vet used the exact same medication to treat a UTI previously so your claim is denied now because he has a stress induced cystitis flair up.""

The UTI was treated with an antibiotic and a pain killer. The cystitis a month later was treated with a pain killer so they called it the same. The vet even noted in their medical record the second one was due to stress. 

I let that go but I shouldn't have. 

A few months later, out of the blue, my same cat got blocked and I had to rush him to the vet. 

They found it was just a mucus plug. They flushed it out and had him stay in the hospital for 3 days. They prescribed him Prazosin just in case for when he went home. 

**PRAZOSIN IS COVERED IN PETS' BESTS OWN LIST OF MEDICATIONS - NO WHERE DOES IT SAY ON YOUR PAPERWORK THAT A NEW MEDICATION WILL BE DENIED FOR BEING RELATED FOR A SUPPOSED PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.** My cat has never taken this medication before!

This all came to about $1780. 

I paid $800 to the vet up front to the do the procedure and the prescription, and the vet filled out a reimbursement form for the balance because THE VET said ""He had not be hospitalized before, nor had a plug before so they shouldn't have a problem reimbursing this.""

It took over 30 days for any of these claims to be looked at.

LO AND BEHOLD, TODAY, EVERYTHING WAS DENIED. They told me it was a preexisting condition all because it related to the same body part. 

Yes. 

First they tell me it's because the medication was the same, now they're telling me it's because it's the same body part. 

Then they tell me if I want to dispute it, it'll take AN ADDITIONAL 60 DAYS TO BE REVIEWED. 

YES, 90 DAYS TO GET A YES OR NO. Meanwhile you're expected to make monthly payments and pay the vet because they will not wait long for their money.

Not anymore!  They are the worst insurance company I have ever dealt with!  Once a claim is submitted it takes over 30 days to get reimbursed!  I'm still waiting for payment on a claim I submitted in January 2020 (it's mid-February!) and there is no information as to why, other than ""we experienced growth and are putting procedures in place to compensate"". . . . they have been saying the same thing for over 2 years!!  Really?!  What does that say about management that can't get their teams up and running for over 2 years!?

I hope you never have to file an appeal!  There is no way to track it! No updates or even mention of the fact that it is under an appeal process in the claims portal and no way to know what is happening.   Why isn't this information posted in the claims section of  the portal??  And all of this for care that I have paid for over 7 years and when I finally need it I'm out of pocket for over 4 months!  I followed the policy rules for coverage and yet my claim was denied and I had to file an appeal. Oh yes, they will say that they needed more information from you, then from the vet, but no one every called or emailed me to ask for that information and my vet spoke to them and submitted a letter and then all of a sudden they need more records, so you are back to square one in the process!! Evidently there is no concept of an ""ongoing case"" and ""supplementing documents"". 

Nope - you are kicked out until the information you didn't know about is somehow produced, then they start all over at square one with the appeal process. Unbelievable!!  Now my appeal is going on 4 months and I'm out of pocket over $700 for covered care!!  It is coming to the point that my dog will be deceased before I ever receive any reimbursement and I cannot afford additional care without being reimbursed!!

When I spoke to the PB representative, I explained that my puppy had 2 issues, that cost a lot of money, and that is why I wanted to get pet insurance.  I was upfront about every detail; I was told that as long as it doesn't happen again, in the first 3 days, after signing up, we would be covered.  Unfortunately he had to have surgery within the first month, and they denied my claim, stating something that was never sent to me, until after I signed up with them.  
One of their selling points was that they settle all claims, within one week; it took months for the first claim.  Then they said, that the first claim can take longer, but all claims after will be with 1 week.

I asked why they didn't pay a different claim, which they said was direct deposited (I never gave them my bank info, or signed up for direct deposit (another lie).  I have one more pending claim, from 1/12, which is going on 5 weeks; still haven't heard anything.

I emailed them, outlining all the above, in great detail, and asked what they are going to do, to restore my faith in Pets Best. GUESS WHAT - NO RESPONSE .  They haven't paid one single claim, but they had no problem billing my credit card, for the 2nd payment.

I also told them to listen to their phone recording, so they can hear exactly what I disclosed, and the reply I got, from their representative. I write a lot of GOOD reviews; this is not the norm for me, to complain about a company. This is justified.

can be reviewed upon resubmission of the claim with required medical records.” My issue with this is that we were not once contacted by Petsbest.

I never got a reply and asked them for an update a couple of weeks later and they said they were sorry for the delay and will get back to me ASAP - which they didnt, I just got this denial. What is really wrong is that they send the denial THE DAY AFTER they took my payment for the next month, which seems really wrong. I also feel that they should not trick people into buying insurance and AFTER paying for several months telling them it could be an option that they cannot insure their pet. This should be checked or confirmed before having people pay. So I have not ONCE been contacted by Petsbest but they do denial my claim because they tried contacting us numerous times? It is impossible that they tried to reach our vet since they do not have her contact info. Communication is REALLY bad here and I would advise anyone to look elsewhere for pet insurance.

My November claim showed a processing time of 20 days.  My most recent claim shows a processing time of 30 days. THIRTY DAYS. Not quite the 2-3 days as promoted on their own website!!!!

I will keep updating my reviews in hopes to keep others from falling for the false claims (no pun intended) made by this company:  

""We apologize about the delay. Your claim and your pet are important to us. This isn't normal for our company to take this long, and I promise it is not intentional. We have experienced an overwhelming amount of growth in our business that was not expected and are currently processing more claims than we could have ever anticipated. I understand this is not your fault, but we are working really hard to get back up to speed, and we appreciate your business as we work towards that goal.""

If this statement were true, this lame and patently false canned message would have disappeared months ago. They are not working hard to get back up to speed, they are not hiring new employees. They are trying to save costs. As for the recent 5 star two day claim processing time, I call bullcrap. They are planted reviews to try and bring the rating up. 

This business was bought out by Synchrony. Synchrony is NOT in the insurance business. They are a financial service company. They offer retail credit cards and not surprisingly, pet care credit. Synchrony doesn't give a rats butt about anything but taking your money and then dragging their time when paying out claims. 

____________________________________________________________________________

What happened? Greed?

Before 2019, claims processing took 2-3 days MAXIMUM. Now it's up to 20 days. What's up with that? The main reason we started with Pets Best over 10 years ago was because of the turn around time and excellent customer service. Now it seems like the company just wants to hold on to your money and make interest on it instead of focusing on customer service. 20 days for a routine claim????

5dc0aaac6048580b04d34d1e,False,False,"Very disappointed with the service of claims. As others have stated it takes them forever to process a claim and do not follow up with you on the status. My first claim for routine visit was processed very quickly, however, my second claim for testing to diagnose a possible kidney problem is taking forever. I too had problems chatting on line with someone so I called to get the status of claim. I was told it was taking longer than usual because of the amount of claims and that it would probably take another 5 days. After 5 days heard nothing and when I checked the status online it said waiting for vet info. They never informed me of needing additional information and this was after they had the claim 2 to 3 weeks. I figured I would give it a couple of days to get. I called again for status and asked if they had received info needed and was told not yet. Contacted my vet and they had no record of receiving a request so they emailed me my cats medical records and I forwarded them to Pets Best. I called next day to see if it was received and they told me I used the wrong email. While the person was on the phone, I emailed again and they confirmed they received and they would review and have the results for me in 10 days. I said it takes 30 days to review a claim for a pet? A human being gets faster results. Was told if a routine office visit the claim is processed quickly. If claim is not for routine visit it takes longer to review medical records. Need to make sure it's not a pre-existing condition. My cat is 2 years old and received him from a shelter at 7 weeks. The shelter certified his health condition before they released him. Well it's been 5 or 6 days and have heard nothing. Emailed claims and asked for a status and no response. Do you think I'm a little perturbed or alot perturbed? 

Updated. Pets Best needs to read their comments on their home page why fast claim processing is important. It states claims are processed within 7 to 10 business days. Does not mention a difference between routine and medical issue claims. It also goes on to say imagine if you paid two thousand for the visit and it took long to get the claim processed. Additional costs can occur for the owner due to interest on charge cards and financial hardships due to checking account  balances. Seems false and misleading information being provided by Pets Best.

Updated: it has now been 38 days and nothing from PetsBest. As you read the comments from PetsBest it could take up to 40 days to process a claim. Now they tell me 45 days. Seems because they needed medical records for additional testing to confirm if my cat had stage 2 kidney disease my claim was pulled from the process and I'm starting all over again. Contacted BBB and unfortunately they said there was nothing they could do if this is company policy. I also spoke to a manager who promised she would pull my claim and try to expedite as a ""favor for me"", but all she did was lie. She has done nothing to assist with this issue. According to her they use no tracking system for claims. They do not keep records of what date claims are received but they take them as them are received,  where you fall in the process for claim being processed so they can tell you there are 30 more before yours, how many claims they have but I was told thousands of new claims were received, they cant track how old your claim is from the date received, etc etc etc. A business that has no tracking system of their claims is bad. They dont seem to track them from what they call routine visit claims and medical claims and they consider testing as medical even though my cat had tests done for his yearly physical and it had been reviewed and closed in a timely manner. This claim is just a continuation of those tests but he has a serious medical claim according to the information provided to the BBB. If I could give a negative rating I would. Claim is supposed to be completed by end of this week. Let's see if that happens.

Later that month he found his way to UW Veterinary Care’s ER because of his extensive eye irritation (& ultimately blindness) that his local vet was not treating.  He then became a patient of UW Veterinary Care’s ophthalmology department.  And you were there to help cover the costs.  We changed veterinary clinics & continued to adapt to our new way of life.  And you were there to help cover the costs of insulin, syringes, testing supplies & medications.  In January 2019, our new vet determined that Ovie was not responding appropriately to Vetsulin.  She was uncomfortable converting him to NPH insulin & we were referred to UW Veterinary Care’s internal medicine department.  We began seeing them in March 2019.  And you were there to help cover the costs.   During his first internal medicine appointment, an ultrasound was completed due to his frequent diarrhea.  That ultrasound found that he had a liver mass.  Initially, we were resistive to putting Ovie through further interventions, as he had two past TPLOs prior to being covered by your company as well as a neck injury.  I worried about him being a high surgical risk due to his multiple co-morbidities.  Also, I didn’t understand that the type of cancer they suspected was growing inside his liver was hepatocellular carcinoma.  Nor did I understand that this type of cancer can be curative with surgical intervention.  After much reading & discussion with UW Veterinary Care’s oncology & internal medicine departments, we came to realize that no intervention was as much of a death sentence as potential surgical complications.  I called your company to discuss what would be covered concerning surgery & possibly chemotherapy if they found metastases.  I will never forget how kind your representative was.  Her first statement to me was “I am so sorry Ovie is going through this”.  She assured me that his insurance plan would cover his care at his chosen 80% reimbursement.  We elected to have a liver lobectomy performed.  The week we were supposed to be having his surgical consult in June 2019, Ovie developed a GI bleed that required hospitalization.  He required multiple blood transfusions.  And you were there to help cover the costs. Come July 2019, we were moving forward with the liver lobectomy.  The liver lobectomy was successful & the tumor was resected with good margins.  We breathed a sigh of relief & focused on post-operative care.  Unfortunately, one week into recovery, Ovie developed pancreatitis.  He required numerous rehospitalizations.  Ultimately mid-August 2019, it was found that in addition to pancreatitis, he had a large liver abscess that required surgical intervention.  The abscess culture grew a multi-drug resistant E.coli that would require four weeks of subcutaneous antibiotics.  And you were there to help cover the costs.  After these long hospitalizations, we thought we were on the right path to recovery.  Unfortunately, by late August 2019, it was found that his liver infection was more extensive post abscess removal & now was growing a more virulent form of multi-drug resistant E.coli.  UW’s internal medicine team broke the news to us that Ovie would never recover & that further efforts would be medically futile.  We were never able to stabilize him enough to bring him home to pass away.  Instead UW Veterinary Care’s internal medicine veterinarian compassionately euthanized our Ovie on August 24th.  And for one final time you were there to help cover the costs. 
In total, Ovie’s medical care, medications & supplies cost nearly $50,000 for the last 10 months of his life.  We cannot thank you enough for helping us make possible to have Ovie as long as we did.   Your company made it so we could focus on him not money.  For this we will be eternally grateful.",5,No one could ask for a better pet insurance company!,0,,2019-09-26T01:52:17.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=171

- Wish I had read the reviews on Yelp 1st -
I agree with Yelper Moo M of Pullman, WA . It is disheartening  the maximum per-incident claim maximums compared to the other Pet Insurance on the market.

Both my sisters are with Pets Best base on my recommendation. As soon as I realized there is a ""maximum per-incident"" in the benefit. I call them and they both are now with a Pet Insurance company that have ""UNLIMITED per-incident "" in the benefit  and lower monthly fees.

Hope this review will help someone else from making the same mistake I did.

No x-rays were taken, just a maybe. But because maybe the injury was due to disc generation, Pets Best refused to pay out as maybe she would not have injured herself if there was maybe no disc generation. Of course, maybe there is no disc generation and she just jumped off wrong, but they'd rather go with the, maybe the injury would rather go with the option that saves them from paying out. Of course dogs get more frail as they get older, and will get injured easier, it does not make it any less an injury. So be sure to only insure young animals, of course, if they are too young, maybe they wouldn't have gotten hurt if there bones were stronger. You never know.
---
Firstly, if it is as you say that the reason the claim was not paid out because her injury was not one of the 8 VERY specific types of accidents my dogs have insurance for, then why blame it on possible disc degeneration when you first told me you won't cover  the claim?
Secondly, I wish you made the policy as clear cut and simple as your above explanation, then I would not have gotten the mistaken impression that my dogs have insurance against accidental injuries. I realize now that the way it is worded, they are not covered for most of the types of injuries I thought of when purchasing the insurance. But my bad, I should have read the contract better.
Thirdly, don't say you give us peace of mind. My dogs only being covered for 8 types of injuries when there are so many ways they can get injured, does not provide me with peace of mind. I'm opening a saving account where I will deposit the money I would have paid to you and start building that.

5d2a4194ccd70b084c60c3bc,False,False,"This is a HORRIBLE company. I signed up for them early on May 9 because my dog's previous insurance associated with her vet's office was too expensive. Of course, the moment this previous policy expired, something cut her paw while on a walk. She had to be taken to the vet the same day that I signed up for her new insurance policy with Pets Best. I had no idea if I would be needing them or not, but I was hoping that no matter what she would be covered that day. I got my bill at the end of the day and told my vet about the new policy and they gave me the documents to submit for a reimbursement. I filed a claim and TWO MONTHS LATER, I am still getting the runaround. I emailed the company and they rather rudely said that my policy didn't actually take effect until THREE DAYS after May 9. So I said that was not transparent of them and they condescendingly explained to me ""how insurance works"" and said some policies don't take effect that day. Being a grown woman, I told them I understood that and that I was simply telling them that that isn't transparent because if that was in the front facing message or the main message given to me the day I signed up, I would have canceled it. I'm canceling my policy just for the sheer fact that the person emailing is rude. Go anywhere else, I know I am.

*Response to comment* No, you are not transparent. You cannot provide proof that these policies are FRONT FACING for new customers because they are not. I have proof of that.

Our male has had skin issues his entire life, so I have not tried to file a claim with the insurance company when it comes to his skin flaring up.   Several months ago, he was diagnosed with a double ear infection.   His ears were cleaned out and he was put on meds to help clear up the infections.   While I was at the vet, they informed me that they had a new shot that they could give him to help with his skin issues and allergies that he suffers from.   I decided to try it to see if it would help his allergies.   In the meantime, I sent a claim into Pets Best for his ear infections.   The receipt from the vet also included the meds given to him for his allergies.   Pets Best denied my claim.   I appealed the claim by sending in all information requested by Pets Best including the original invoice, the appeals form and a letter from my vet stating that the ear infections were NOT caused by his allergies.  Pets Best denied the claim again, stating they never received the letter from the vet.   

Again, I appealed the denial, and again I submitted the paperwork required - the original invoice, the appeal letter and the letter from my vet.   This time I requested confirmation that all was received and that if they didn't receive the letter to let  me know.  I never heard anything back, until today.   A letter came in the mail and denied our claim AGAIN!!!

5cf69226b055990790e208de,False,False,"Horrible company. Their policy clearly states that a pre-existing condition is one that occurred in the 12 months prior to the policy issuance. I purchased a policy for my Dog in February 2019. The only thing that happened in the 12 months prior was a ACL replacement (TPL). When he was younger he did have skin allergies, but they were controlled with immunotherapy prior to 2014. In May he had a mysterious skin infection. They denied $435 of his treatment and accepted $22 towards deductible and said it was pre-existing. They tried to tell me how they did accept some on the phone. This is hilarious. These guys are clowns. In no way is it pre-existing as he has not received any treatment for skin related issues since prior to 2014. I will be reporting these scam artists to the state insurance board. They are not to at all trustworthy.

Update: In response to Pet's Best. It is clearly stated in your policy documents, which I have since forwarded on the the insurance board, ""A. PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS: In determining which Conditions are Pre-Existing, we look at the 18 months preceding the Policy Effective Date and exclude any Conditions that were Present during that period.""

Update 2: Actually the policy is not clear. I only typed the first paragraph because I do not have time to waste retyping the whole policy. And it was not a chronic condition. It was completely cured before the end of 2014 from immunotherapy. Besides the skin infection that he just had was not definitively linked to allergies. It is of unknown origin.

April 17 - Email to me that Vet 1 has not provided the last 12 months of records. 
April 17 - I called Vet 1 and they told me that they had sent over the records on April 12th.
April 23 - I got an email from Pets Best that Vet 1 has not provided the last 12 months of records. 
April 24 - New email to me to request for records from Vet 1 dating June 1 to present. 
April 24 - I replied back that we have not been going to Vet 1 since May 2018. I also called the Vet 1 and they called Pets Best to say the same thing.
April 26 - I got an email from Pets best saying that the claim is closed because despite multiple attempts you could not get the records requested. Both Vet 1 and I had communicated with PetsBest that there are NO Additional records to be sent because the dogs have not been to VCA HOLLY ST since mid 2018!
April 26th - I called to communicate to PetsBest that the vet and I had both sent information about this and I was told that the email was just automated and that it had not actually been closed and that you had received the information from me and the VCA vet. 
April 29th - I get a phone call from Pets Best saying that the case has indeed been closed and the only way to have it opened is to have VET 2 send the last 12 months of records! When I asked if pets best had even contact VET 2 the answer was no.

They then denied the claim a week later saying that it was because of an observation about the dogs anatomy and they have a right to deny it now even though they paid for it before!

I am currently in the appeals process but am not optimistic based on the above. I will be taking it up with California Department of Insurance.",1,PetsBest - Just Time Wasting and Frustration,0,,2019-05-04T16:16:38.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=179

Well I opted for two kittens and immediately I searched for pet insurance. I was skeptical, I admit.  I found pets best and they seemed to provide more than some others like the wellness program. I signed up. A few days later I take the kittens to their first vet appointment and submit a wellness claim. That was Tuesday, it's now Friday of the same week and I already have my reimbursement in my bank! I am absolutely thrilled!

5cba0cfca8436908c40c617e,False,False,"My french bulldog Charlie throughout all 4 years of his little life has had numerous illnesses. This past January 2019 he was diagnosed with a UTI (very rare for male dogs but that’s our luck) so after receiving treatment I decided to obtain pet insurance. This past February 209 I joined Pets Best insurance, their rates were the most reasonable and the deductible wasn’t absolutely outrageous. A few weeks later after obtaining the insurance Charlie was diagnosed with another UTI. I submitted multiple claims as we’ve had multiple revisits for check ups, urine testing, ultrasound, the works. I received notification that NONE of the services would be covered and NONE would go towards my deductible for my plan because it’s all being considered a “pre-existing” condition. I treated his UTI in January based off the antibiotics prescribed by my vet and his symptoms were completely gone when I joined the company’s policy. The policy didn’t go into effect for 7 days after obtaining and we were WELL beyond the 7 days. So for all you pet parents out there thinking about getting insurance; DO NOT go with Pets Best. I feel trapped now because anything we are currently doing for him won’t be covered by another company.",1,Not Covering New Illnesses,0,,2019-04-19T18:01:32.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=179

Charlie is laid back very sheltered and an indoor pet, but he likes his walks.

I do agree with all the reviews that the customer service staff are very courteous and nice a couple of times I did call.

HOWEVER, the reason I'm giving PBI 3* because the premiums keeps going up every year eventhough we never had to make any claims yet. Charlie's premium keeps going up because of his age and more claims from other sick and accidents prone dogs was the answer given to me when I called in to ask why the premium keeps going  up.

In my opinion, that isn't fair at all to healthy dogs with zero claims so far.
I think like good grades students are given a discount on their car insurance premiums, healthy dogs should also be given a discount too for zero claims.

I hope PBI is going to consider that, and not punished all healthy pet owners. Thank you.",3,3* for rising premiums fir a healthy and zero claims pet.,0,,2019-04-12T21:34:25.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petsbest.com?page=179

5c75ce5a97afa107f88764ef,False,False,"I would have never anticipated writing a negative review for Pets Best Insurance.  When I first got my policy for my English Mastiff, the annual fee was $476.16 (2016-2017).  Mines was a modest policy - $200 deductible, 80% reimbursement, and $5000 annual coverage.  The first year was a rough year for my dog and I took that policy right up to the $5000 annual coverage.  The service during that first year was so phenomenal that I wrote a fabulous review for Pets Best and continued the accolades by suggesting this pet insurance to anyone who would listen. The next year, the policy went up to $631.23 (2017-2018).  I assumed such a large jump was due to the amount I had claimed, but was told that was not the case.  The representative was extremely nice and explained the process.  She stated that during the puppy stage, the policy is normally higher and once he passes the puppy stage, the cost will decrease to be followed by an increase when he becomes a senior and his health is anticipated to decline.  I was fine with this explanation because it made sense.  The next year, my policy went down to $607.94 - just as the rep had predicted (2018-2019).  Imagine my surprise when I received my most recent policy renewal to a tune of $1003.71 (2019-2020).  When I called to get an explanation, the responses were just not acceptable.  The dog is 3 years old and in great shape (that is past the puppy stage, right?).  BTW, we filed no claims because there were no emergencies or big ticket items that required action.  So, ""zero claims"" for the policy period 2018-2019 and the reward is a policy increase of $395.77.  Thanks Pets Best!  Just don't buy the reasoning of he is still in his puppy stage where he is curious and still getting into things - when he is between the ages of 4-6 the rates will go down - after age 6 the rates will go up because he will be considered in his senior years.  Oh, okay.  Well, I have wasted enough money and time.  Needless to say, this policy will not be renewed.  This is so disappointing  and sad at the same time.

If you are looking for a pet insurance company that will not dupe you when it is truly needed and when a pet is truly ill, look elsewhere. There are other companies that do not have maximum payouts - when a pet gets sick the whole point of insurance is to help pay for the illness. Pet's Best (at least when I signed up) never intended to pay beyond the first couple of thousand of dollars even though my premium went from $30 per month to over $90 per month when i finally had enough.

My dog had a scare last year that was either sago palm toxicity or trauma leading to liver damage, they never really found out why.  Either way, I got pets best before his final follow up with his vet in which he had a mass on his head that may/may not be removed, other than that he had a clean bill of health. Ten days later I went to a different vet for a second opinion on the mass, and they told me they thought it would resolve, but if it needed to be removed it would be about 40% less than my other vet, but also that he now had an ear infection. He was treated for the ear infection and it resolved.  I didn't submit that to pets best because I knew the mass had been there for a couple months now. Two months later he has another ear infection that developed an aural hematoma requiring surgery.  They told me that since the original ear infection fell 2 days within the 14 day window that they were considering it pre-existing. I told them the definition of the word ""pre-existing"" is that it was there prior to me getting the policy, which it clearly wasn't since he had an exam with a vet the day after I purchased the policy. So at this point pets best has two options: do the right thing and reimburse me because the condition was indeed not ""pre-existing"" per the definition of the word.

Ultimately I decided on Pets Best due to a combination of reasonable rates, wellness add-ons, and reviews. It's still a little early to tell, but it looks like I may have made a bad choice. Easily corrected by moving to a new insurer when my policy renews at the 1-year mark. 

16 days into my new policy, I took my new puppy in for his first check-up and to get shots. At the time, I also had the doctor look at his eyes which had been a little red. The doctor determined it was conjunctivitis and put him on an ointment. I submitted a claim and it was denied because sickness coverage doesn't begin until 14 days after you start your policy. I took my pup in a week and a half later because the redness didn't clear, and was again denied because the symptoms ""started"" before the coverage period. 

First of all, I'm not sure how they determined when the symptoms started. All I submitted were the receipts and they assumed it started before the 14-day mark. Secondly, this is not the kind of behavior I want out of my insurance company.

5c12d7319d37800b04033df7,False,False,"Where do I start? If I could give less than 1 star I would. Well, my experience with this company was fine as long as I was paying my monthly dues and had no claims. 

I’ve had nothing but problems this year with them and denying claim after claim. 

I found out they needed medical records from my dogs past vet visits. We’ve taken our dog to numerous vets to try to figure out his issues. We got on the track of food allergies and did extensive testing for this. The current vet put him on a special food so it won’t trigger his immune system (this is what the vet told us). 

Ok, that problem solved. He did fine on that food until he got an infection and was put on antibiotics. This was August of this year (2018). He’s been back numerous times for itching, licking, etc. amoungst other non allergy issues. The claims were getting denied  left and right. They denied the whole claim, what was thought to be allergy related or not. I finally contacted them and asked what the problem was for these getting denied. They were STILL wanting medical records. I asked them if I needed to go get them and submit them and was told over and over they would get them to just give the name of the vet office and they would take care of the rest. I was told after one phone call what vet records they were missing so I went to the vet and got them myself. When I called to find out who to send them to, they said they had those, they needed another vets records. WHAT?!?!?!? I was beyond frustrated by this. I asked what they needed to get these claims taken care of because this had been going on for 4 months and was unacceptable! 

They finally informed me that the vets notes pointed toward his allergy problem. I informed them that he had preexisting FOOD allergies and now we were looking at environmental allergies. I asked if they lump them together because in my mind, they are two completely separate issues. They said they are different but the vets notes are too vague. They don’t specify which allergies the vet is talking about. Well, looking at the treatments we’ve been trying, it should be pretty clear we aren’t working on a food allergy.

Long story short, still no resolution and now I’m working on appealing this. If you have A LOT of fight in you, go with this company.

5be5bb409d37800568860201,False,False,"Their appeals process treats you like a criminal and is extremely slow. We've filed an appeal which is now taking over a month to undo their improper rejection of my dog's surgery.  I have multiple dogs and we decided based on our history with our oldest English bulldog we should invest in some insurance for our youngest English.  She started favoring her back left leg and we took her into our vet who determined she has a strained/damaged cruciate ligament which he believed would develop into a full tear if left untreated.  So we scheduled surgery only to receive a rejection notice from Pets Best a few days before taking her in. It was rejected because they said it was a pre existing condition before insurance was established.  I called to ask for further explanation and was told 2 years ago we text(sent a text message via personal cell phones) a vet saying our dog's leg seemed hurt and before bringing her in; did they think it was worth the visit? Texts ended with ""just watch her for a few days and if it progresses bring her in"".  Then unbeknownst to us the vet added this record to our youngest pup's file claiming it to be a cruciate ligament injury.  No exam, no official consult and no further treatment after text.  The kicker being this was our eldest dog's paw the text made no claim to which pet (we have 3 total)...  Now we've appealed with a letter from the vet admitting the record was attached to the wrong dog and in error.  It's been about a month under appeal now.  I called today because as predicted by the vet I believe it is a full tear now.  Scheduled surgery but it'll be 2 weeks of my dog suffering before they can fit her in... Now I'm told they've requested my other dog's complete medical history before they'll process my appeals claim.  So I've waited a month just to be told we need to submit an unrelated dog's complete medical history for a text which we never followed up on and a diagnosis that was not correct or confirmed.  One, why did no one call or email that they needed more information rather than making us wait?  If I hadn't called would this still not be processed? I asked to speak with a claims processer and was told they're too busy dealing with appeals(so apparently they have a hefty rejection work load), then I asked to speak someone else (anyone) and was rudely told no one else can do anything.  They've literally treated my wife an I like criminals trying to cheat the system.  Honestly a random text from 2 years ago was not in my memory until it was being quoted to me on the phone.  I'm more upset because not only is it unrelated but they never physically saw a dog.

We made 1 claim since we joined PetsBest, and it was declined because according to them, they were unable to get the Vet record from our previous Vet in NJ. We called the vet ourselves and got the records in a few minutes!
We then sent the records to PetsBest and after a couple of days they claimed they did not receive them and that they also needed the doctor's notes.  Again we had to call the Vet ourselves, doing their job for them.
After this, the claim was still denied, because they said they needed additional information from the vet in FL!
We canceled the policy and went back to Trupanion.

In response to the reply below.  It is simply inconceivable that the records that PetsBest was ""unable"" to get from the previous Vet, we got ourselves in a 5min call. Additionally, every time we provided the requested documents ( again, doing their job for them) an additional set of documents was requested in order to process the claim. It just seems that the company just wanted to deny the claim no matter what we did.  In the end, we provided everything they requested, said that they would continue to process the claim regardless of our cancellation, and when I called today (after 3 months) to get an update, they provided the same response of not being able to process the claim due to not being able to receive all the documents.

As you can see from the representatives refusal to understand the gripe, continuing to respond for responses sake this isn’t a company I would ever partner with again.

$51 a month doesn’t get you coverage for a single vaccination during the life of a 6 month old puppy. Whether they believe the policy documentation to be clear or not isn’t the customer issue. The policy structure is bad value for money - that is the dissatisfaction and surprise.

I really do not need another corporate defense statement so please, there is no need to defend a position I’m no interested in. I wish to warn others about my error, when paying $51 a month you do not get basic vaccination cover - they are monthly add ons.

5b9ac18c8c83fd0b58d7b268,False,False,"Has your puppy ever had diarrhea? Heaven forbid that it has had it (once) before purchasing pet insurance from PetsBest. We purchased (10/9/17) pet insurance 6 weeks after getting our first dog (11/29/17-seems like a pretty reasonable time to acquire it) and filed our first claim with PetsBest after bringing our dog in for diarrhea for a second time (1/12/18), once prior to having PetsBest.  They applied that visit toward our $200 deductible so they didn't technically have to reimburse us for anything yet. We then brought her in for the 3rd time for diarrhea on July 23 (7/23/18), roughly 6 months later.  We submitted the claim and were denied as it was deemed a ""pre-existing condition."" A few things are wrong with that: 1. Diarrhea is a symptom, not a condition. 2. No vet has ever diagnosed her with Chronic Diarrhea. 3. Their policy defined a Chronic Condition as one that cannot be cured but only treated and managed- which Layla's diarrhea has since been cured and is defecating perfectly fine and has been for quite some time.  Moral of the story...PetsBest is GREAT until you are actually benefiting from pet insurance.  If you have EVER been to the vet before purchasing insurance, beware, because they will find any way possible to tie those previous vet visits to ""pre-existing"" conditions in order to avoid having to reimburse you.  They will gladly take your premium payments, but be warned, they will fight you on paying out.  They do have an appeals process, but that too, is a joke. PetsBest reviews PetsBest's decision and then if you make it to round 2 of their appeal, PetsBest sends your appeal to a ""third-party"" (that they contract) for another review.  When questioned about possibly submitting the appeal to an independent third-party, they said that ""this is how it is typically done"" and couldn't provide further information. Its a joke. I cant wait to see the BS they spew in their response. *waits for the copy and pasted response, subbing pets name, from their customer service team*



IN REGARDS TO THEIR REPLY:
Looking at our Claims, exactly 2 claims mention anything in regards to gastro issues.  All other mentions of gastro issues were essentially questions from the vet, wondering if her issues got better.  None of those questions were billed or charged for but were simply conversations with our vet. All of the other referred to issues weren't anything that PetsBest was responsible for reimbursing for, but direction as to how to proceed from our vet and we were there for other issues and happened to have the conversation while we were already there for unrelated issues, again, not adding to any other expenses incurred by PetsBest. There is no indication of the symptoms getting resolved because we haven't taken our healthy dog to the vet since.  She was on medication (antibiotics) for 10 days following the first vet visit. Your argument would be valid if you had paid for any of those instances.  Only once did we receive antibiotics (billed towards our deductible) and canned food (not covered by PetsBest) resulting in PetsBest denying all responsibility to reimburse us.

Reply to Pet Best: Don't believe that the review process is the answer. Pet Best is in the Insurance Business where their plan is to DENY CLAIMS FIRST. WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO FIGHT FOR COVERAGE.
Second reply to Pet Best:  PET BEST INSURANCE IS INDEED NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  The veterinarian did not decide that this was a pre-existing condition.  IN FACT THE VETERINARIAN SAID THIS CAME ON SUDDENLY.  Pet Best told me that they made this decision, that it was a pre-existing condtion.  An infection, that needed an antibiotic, is a pre-existing condition?  (REALLY?) And from then on everything is a pre-existing condition, because the adjusters at Pet Best said so,  that the Pet Owner will have to appeal and waste their time in doing so?? Pet Best can just DENY YOUR CLAIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  WHY WASTE TIME AND GET UPSET OVER TRYING TO GET PAID ON YOUR CLAIM.  BETTER TO JUST PUT THE AMOUNT OF THE PREMIUM IN THE BANK, AND USE THAT SAVINGS FOR YOUR PET WHEN NEEDED. ***I stand by my assessment***RIPOFF COMPANY.  DON'T BUY PET INSURANCE.

While I did not utilize the accident or illness plans (and I always hope not too!!!), I have utilized the Wellness Benefit for the yearly evaluations, vaccines, heartworm and flea/tick preventions and submitted them the same day for processing. It was super easy, took a picture of the invoice, uploaded on the website - through the app, DONE!! 😃 In less than 24 hours (actually it was less than 12 hours), they processed my claim, provided me with an EOB (Explanation of Benefits) and it will be directly deposited in my bank account of record. I never saw such wonderful and compassionate service! Vets bills are not cheap. Any help you can get is wonderful. Knowing they process these effectively so you can provide the best care for your furbabies is such a relief and provides peace of mind. 

I greatly encourage anyone looking for pet insurance for their furbaby, who is a part of your family, look no further than Pets Best. And I can say their prices are reasonable. I was able to insure my 10 year old doggie, with no problems. Knowing I have that for her and my other furbabies, that I can provide care to them, with no issues or concerns, provides me with such relief!

I had also noticed in the vet's office a notice that stated if I did not turn in the insurance paperwork at time of the procedure, they would refuse to complete it. I called Pets Best on 06/01/15 in a bit of a panic & spoke with a lovely young customer service rep (whose name I forgot to write down) and she calmed me down, assuring me that all I had to do was to print out a claim form & complete it, attach the vet bill, mail it to them & that they'd do everything possible to maximize the payout on the claim.

566f1fc10000ff000924c060,False,False,"I love this company! We have had a policy for two years now and although it is cliche, my only regret is not getting a policy sooner. We purchased our policy after paying $5,000 to fix our dogs leg. Pets Best was recommended to me by a friend and had very competitive rates but also great coverage. Remember you get what you pay for.
A year after having our policy our vet told us that we need to do some mass removals and lab test. Cost? $1,800. I sent in information to PetsBest and their claims department sent me approval right away for the procedure. We would have done the procedure with or without our pet insurance, but being able to get the majority of the cost covered allowed us to do it right away and not worry about such and unexpected financial impact. After the procedure I submitted my invoice online and had my claim processed and money in my account within 24 hours. The customer service rep that helped me on my 1st claim couldn't have been better to work with.
About a year later we made our 2nd claim. Our poor pup's other rear leg blew out just playing in the backyard. She wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary and all of the sudden she wouldn't put weight on her leg. We knew right away from our previous experience that surgery was inevitable. We received our vet quote, just under $5,000 for this time around. I contacted Pets Best again and they told me everything I should get from the vet to file a claim after surgery and informed me about what may be and may not be covered. They made it easy to understand and I was sure it would be covered. AND IT WAS! I send in medical records and the invoice using their online claim form and submission process. Within 2 days Pets Best paid 80% of my dogs surgery expenses, less annual deductible of course.
Customer service, fast turn times, and their integrity is what makes Pets Best an exceptional company. For those ""money"" people out there, the money Pets Best has paid in claims is equal to several years of my monthly premiums.
My dog is now half dog, half machine but she will walk almost as perfectly as before for the rest of her life and be as happy as can be.
