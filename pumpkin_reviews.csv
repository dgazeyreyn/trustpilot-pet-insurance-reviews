Two things to beware of before you might choose this insurance:
1) If you pay for 'preventive care', their package for things like vaccines, wellness exams, parasite meds, etc.. there is mostly ZERO benefit, it is simply giving them the money first and then they pay it out back to you, so they can make interest on your money.  It is not Insurance of any kind, if you use the amount you paid for you're done, if you cancel you will owe the money back to them, if you didn't use it and you cancel, well they keep it anyway.  Clever!!  Now it does say on the screen it isn't insurance however it is pitched like an add on of sorts as you're setting up your insurance... would you like to add preventive care for $10 (or whatever) a month?  Sure...  later to find out it is completely worthless...the refunds it states you get is your OWN money!

2) Any vaccines that you think are covered or eligible, well if they're two doses, like Lepto for instance, 1 vaccine given in two parts 10 days apart, well to them that's two vaccines so they won't cover the 2nd dose.  Ask a vet if this is still one vaccine, of course it is.

3) If you call and question anything, well that's when the rudeness starts, condescending phone techs.. I had one ask me personal questions about what vaccines I have and then hang up on me.

We will see if they listen to the actual doctor who treated my puppy, but so far they still maintain it is a pre-existing condition despite what the licensed veterinary doctor says. 

****previous review below****

While I understand that insurance companies exist to make money, there is a point where the coverage that is advertised as covered is nowhere near what is actually covered, which results in customers who trust this company with the health of their beloved pets only to be completely let down.  I signed up for Pumpkin and then had an issue where my 3 year old chihuahua woke up and did not want to eat and was nauseous. I took her to the vet, who said something must be bothering her tummy, and gave her anti-nausea medicine.  She was fine a day later.  My claim was then DENIED by Pumpkin because 170 days ago (before she was covered on the plan) she had an upset stomach and we took her to the vet where she was given medicine for a day and was completely better.  Because she had not gone 180 days without any GI symptoms, I was told this was a pre-existing condition.  AN UPSET STOMACH IS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION!!  This can be caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites, trauma, ingestion, as well as other physical ailments that manifest as nausea in dogs, but somehow an upset stomach, regardless of the cause, IS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION!!  Now, my poor chihuahua must go another 180 days WITHOUT ANY GI SYMPTOMS AT ALL or no matter what it is, it will not be covered.  To me, this means the company who advertises caring about your pet is actually trying to ensure that your pet does NOT get the help they need.  There is no trust here, and I am severely disappointed.  I believe there is a way to make money with pet insurance without completely eliminating promised coverage at the expense of the health of your pet.",1,They WILL find a way to deny your pet!!,0,2024-02-06T00:00:00.000Z,2024-02-07T18:48:45.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.pumpkin.care?page=5

64b6e75b196580a25a6235cc,False,False,"I just received a notification from Pumpkin regarding an appeal to a claim I submitted and they labeled my dog  as having ""consistent behaviors of aggression and anxiety."" I filed an appeal for a claim that was denied because they decided it was a pre-existing condition. After the 4th of July on a night that I went out, my 7 year old German Shepherd was barking uncontrollably. My neighbor told me there were some large fireworks going off which probably brought on the anxiety, plus he started chewing on some things; for the first time he showed these signs of anxiety. The next day I called the Vet and he prescribed a medication that would calm the dog. Pumpkin originally denied the $57 medication claim because they called it as a pre-existing condition. They again requested all his records from the Vet, it was obvious they were phishing for an excuse to deny the claim. Even my Vet submitted a letter to Pumpkin. They claim that due to his records they found him to be aggressive and they have now labeled him that way.

My German Shepherd goes for grooming once a month, has never bit anyone, he is well trained, loves people and children, so these are not signs of an aggressive dog. When he goes to the Vet, yes he gets uncomfortable if they are looking at a wound or getting shots. If you are taking your dog to the Vet it's because they are sick or have some kind of injury. How do you expect a dog to react, a muzzle is put on him and he then feels safe and calm. 

In the email by Brittany Spears she stated the following; ""As a sign of good faith we are allowing Dexter's firework phobia separate from his pre-existing anxiety and aggression at the vet. This claim has been reprocessed. Since Dexter has displayed consistent behaviors of aggression and anxiety at the vet which began prior to the policy effective date, this condition will remain a pre-existing condition.""

64447d9b734f97e68fa35d25,False,False,"I like the multi-pet discount and the discount for paying yearly vs. monthly. It was easy to sign up. Initially, I had started out signing up for Lemonade pet insurance but on their website, all along the way the pages were 'speaking' to me - the customer - in a garrulous and obtuse way that really turned me off. I signed up for Pumpkin instead, the sign-up process with you all was colorful, polite,  interactive and enjoyable.

** Update, 05.07.23 - I was looking over other reviews and saw a negative one questioning the usefulness of pet insurance. This is why I decided to get it. I had to euthanize my cat Rylin due to liver failure. In hindsight, I could have taken better care of him. If caught early he could have lived much much longer. Over the years I have given him the minimum care, checkups for rabies vaccinations only, a couple of scares here and there that led to nothing and were not very expensive. Then came 'The Day About Which I Shall Never Speak Again'. He seemed 'off' started hiding under my dresser, took him to the vet...and it was too late, the extent of, expense of, time involved for, liver failure treatment could not be done by me, a single mom struggling financially already, or done by the local vet's office. I could contact the vet university 2 hours away and see if they could treat him. Rylin was my favorite pet EVER, I have never gotten over having to say goodbye to him. Pet insurance came to mind but I dismissed it. I should have taken better preventative care of him. I built more money into my 'pet health care' savings allotment, for yearly exams and bloodwork for my remaining adult pets, all recommended vaccinations. I have had pets all my life and never covered my pets, alas that was before I adopted Shimmer (boy 4 yo cat) and Kiesza (girl kitten). Kiesza likes to play with EVERYTHING, tooth floss picks, bottle caps, popcorn kernels anything on the floor that moves (thank you son) top on her list is...bugs. In Texas we have very large 4-inch sized beetles (they look like giant roaches and fly!) Kiesza likes to 'keep the population under control' let's say. In other words I frequently find half-eaten bodies around the apartment. For which I am thankful. One day however I found a live one scurrying across my bedroom floor. I sprayed the heck out of it with bug spray poison, covered it with a little box and went about my day. I went back a little bit later and found Kiesza in there and the box had been moved and the poison covered bug was gone! (ER trip #1) Shimmer likes to play with elastic hair bands. For a couple of years I thought no big deal it entertains him. Until one day I watched him eat one in front of me! Since it wasn't a mystery, I KNEW he had consumed one I needed to act fast before it started getting digested (ER trip #2) Just when I had gotten my savings account back up to where it was, one night recently Kiesza started throwing up, over and over, she never has thrown up and she was now throwing up every ten 10 seconds. My mind raced with all the things she could have consumed this time. ER trip #3 with her throwing up in the car on the way. Both are fine now. Three trips to the animal ER in the last 2 years (almost $10k total between the two of them) and I relented; decided that unless I was going to either try to find someone else to adopt them or euthanize them for a few hundred dollars for swallowing something rather than get them xrays, bloodwork, endoscopy, IV, overnight observation, etc. then I needed to give insurance a try. $10,000 / 24 months = $416 / month for 2 cats. I have a 3rd who's low maintenance but is considered 'geriatric'. I had to weigh the likelihood that one or both of the troublemakers will consume something else in their lifetime (highly likely) and how much I value having them (GREATLY, my son and I love them!) and what is going through my mind at 2 am when I'm standing in the exam room with the ER vet looking at x-rays, he's handed me a quote for the cost of various options and he's standing there waiting, after asking me how I would like them to proceed. $110.46 * 24 months = $2,651.04 insurance for 3 cats with Pumpkin which covers 90% after a $250 annual deductible. I need to start saving for my son's college tuition. He may also need braces. I decided that I was going to take the best care of my cats moving forward, which means I need to sacrifice a little bit NOW each month to be prepared for inevitable future trips to the animal ER.",5,I like the multi-pet discount and the…,0,2023-04-12T00:00:00.000Z,2023-04-23T02:36:43.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.pumpkin.care?page=19

They say to call if you want to pay for the year to avoid the fee. After signing up, I called to pay for the year but was told I would still have to pay the extra fee for the first month because I did the sign up online. Pretty awful way to get $2 extra dollars out of everyone. Also, your term starts right away meaning you are already paying for coverage but they don’t offer coverage for 15 days. I get the waiting period for people who might wait to insure their pet until there is a problem but don’t charge for the period when you won’t provide coverage. Even the waiting period seems unfair when the dog is brand new to you. I insured my dog the day I got her but still have to wait 15 days and given she is a puppy, already have lots of vet expenses that won’t be reimbursed.

640ba30bd202534bc9fab596,False,False,"If I could give zero stars, I would. In January of 2022, I got Pumpkin for my 2 dogs. Their vet had emailed saying they were finally opening spots back up after the Covid wave of appointments had shut down their availability. I made a check up appointment for a month away, and then got pumpkin as they claimed they'd cover cancer if it was 180 days symptom free and cleared by an oncologist as having not metastasized. There were no signs anything was wrong with either of them, but since one was 14 years old, I wanted to be safe. Boy, was I wrong. 

About 3 weeks later, 1 week before our appointment, and 1 week after the waiting period, my doggo collapsed outside while playing in the snow. Turns out she had bronchitis, but due to a previous scare with cancer, our vet immediately sent us back to the oncologist thinking it had metastasized to her lungs. It hadn't. We had gotten the clear from the oncologist in March of the previous year, saying her scans came back normal after her surgery and just to monitor and come back in every year. 

When I submitted the claim for her appointments stating the vet thought it could be cancer, they immediately said it was a pre-existing condition and it wasn't covered. Even though their site said that it would be, given these circumstances.  I'd even called ahead and asked about that as ""we cover pre-existing conditions"" sounded too good to be true.a

The very nice rep advised me to file an appeal and said that they'd get back to me within 90 days. 90 days later, they were still screwing me around and I was still paying for the insurance that never paid out as they said if the appeal came through in my favor, but I didn't have the insurance anymore, they wouldn't be obligated to pay for any of the treatments she'd been receiving.

I even went as far as to have both my vet and oncologist sign statements stating that there was no reason to believe that it was pre-existing or had anything to do with her previous cancer and submitted it.

Finally, I gave up and cancelled as I needed the funds to go through specialist after specialist trying to figure out what was wrong. (she'd had bronchitis that had turned into pulmonary hypertension and we finally found that out 3 months later after 3 specialists and having to schedule things a month in advance.) 2 weeks later my girl was gone and I'd paid $1200 on top of all of the specialist appointments for insurance that DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. 

Got the notice a week after she passed stating that they had denied my appeal because the at March 2021 appointment at the oncologist, they had written one line in her record that said they noticed a slight wheeze IN A PUG but nothing showed on the scan, so I was just to monitor and take her to her primary if it got worse. So their in-house vet, that must have absolutely no soul, concluded that she had had chronic bronchitis since March of 2021 that caused her to collapse in late January of 2022 and THAT made it a pre-existing condition.

6406655716f06b3a77872c1f,False,False,"HORRIBLE..HORRIBLE...HORRIBLE!!! TOTALLY MISLEADING!!!!

Been with Pumpkin for 3yrs...My rates and deductible have gone up since day one....from around 70 to now over 100 dollars and my deductible has DOUBLED!!...all while having the SAME EXACT PLAN!!

I scheduled my dog for a NEW WELLNESS exam because she was seeing a NEW VET for the FIRST time. My previous vet closed her practice. 

This new vet is 45min away, so I also scheduled for my pup to have her CYTOPOINT shot at the same time while I was there so I did not have to come back again just for a shot. I had all her previous records and my dog was NOT sick, but needed her first and initial exam at her now NEW vet. 

MY CLAIM for the exam was DENIED because PUMPKIN claims that this was a 'sickness exam' only because she happened to have the cytopoint shot while she was there. SHE was NOT sick...and the exam was NOT to examine or determine a SICKNESS...IT WAS A WELLNESS CHECKUP/EXAM ONLY for being at a brand new practice!! I understand that the shot itself was related to  an allergy, but that does NOT automatically deem her EXAM a SICKNESS EXAM.
In order for this exam to have been covered...I would have to have gone one day for her exam....then go right back another day for a cytopoint shot. So the expectation is for pumpkin customers to make two separate 45min there and back trips in the same week for something I could do in one trip just so they can't state I was there for a 'sick exam'. 

ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!! 

What's worse...is this SAME instance has occurred previously which they DID cover and NOW are singing a totally different tune. 

Not only is pumpkin completely irrational with their claim denials...but also completely inconsistent with the reasoning for them as well!!!

63e5024d9b64b1bdaf51f289,False,False,"If you can get in on time (aka: before any pre-existing conditions form), this is a lifesaver. After facing crippling vet bills with my older German shepherd who I did not think to get insurance on, I rapidly placed my younger shepherd on Pumpkin. I was worried since about her lack of robust vet records since she was from Mexico, but we got on a plan, and it has been a year of being able to breathe a little easier. 

Pumpkin is fast to work with you on the phone, and generally processes claims quickly. They cover a lot, and I've always been anxious about pet insurance trying to find the most miniscule excuse to avoid covering something that falls under the policy (as some vets have told me is common with some insurers), but Pumpkin is not one of those. Even though they raise the price as your companion ages, the sheer positive experience I've had does not make this a deal breaker for me. 

Some constructive criticism: it would be nice if Pumpkin could let you access your past electronic claims. Once you submit an electronic claim, you can't see what you submitted anymore. It would also be nice if Pumpkin let you access the full records that they pull from the vet when processing claims. This is just a detail that would make it more convenient, rather than taking notes on the side to keep track of illness history and pulling records from the vet frequently.",5,Hop on Board before Your Pet Ages!,0,2023-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,2023-02-09T16:25:17.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.pumpkin.care?page=30

1. Preventative essentials will cover some basic stuff initially. (But not all by far)
2. Standard tests like felv and fiv tests are not covered. (By insurance, you would think that would be covered, because it’s ordered by the veterinarian and is testing for an illness, right?)
3. They will make you submit health records and the invoices with every claim and then reject your claim based on MISSING records. (I’ve resubmitted multiple claims with every piece of paperwork for each individual cat multiple times) NOTABLY they will not ask for those records, just keep the claim in “review” for MONTHS at a time and then send you a rejection notice.

628eadbb4b16276ac9909868,False,False,"A fair and helpful company. Honest. You have to pay the vet up front and they reimburse you in about 30-90 days. You can just give the card with other companies to the vet who accepts it as payment.

But in exchange for this, which is made very clear, you get a lot of regular care services paid for quickly. Shots, checkups, health checks, nail trimming ( a limited amount-see their list), and that is paid from Pumpkin quickly. Major problems have to be paid for by the Insurance company that underwrites serious care.

The Present value yearly regular treatment is far higher than other emergency care which happens but more rarely.  Especially as it likely prevents serious problems later.

Still, If  Pumpkin offered both groups of payment, giving an insurance card to the vet (Direct bill) AND [preventative care, I would be willing to pay 2-3X for the insurance.  

A dark recession is coming so it might be wise to offer this method as a choice so customers don't flee a growing company.

6228bdca9d31e15e378b4683,False,False,"Pumpkin Pet Insurance  is nothing but a logo and a website. I insured two cats at a very high premium price ($176/month). I drank their marketing Kool-aid instead of going with a proven company. So that's my fault. I submitted claims at the beginning of November for one cat. I received nothing except the same auto-generated email for WEEKS. When I called over a month later, the customer service rep investigated and told me that my claims were being sent for ""audit"" on December 16th. I was told that the audit process would take between 30-45 days. Called again in January: ""we're waiting on medical records"" (which had already been emailed in November.) Because I had to provide medical records from birth for a 13-yr old pet, I reached out to my pet's previous vet and uploaded 65 pages of medical records. Then I was reprimanded by a customer service supervisor for doing so: ""we reach out to the vets."" Just a delaying tactic. Called again in February: ""we have to review these records."" It's March. 99% of the claims were denied because vomiting and constipation are ""pre-existing."" (What cat doesn't vomit? Those are symptoms, not a disease.) But should it BECOME a disease,  like lymphoma - even 10 years from now - and even after their supposed 180-day ""recovery"" time, they won't cover it. I wasted $90 in premiums EACH MONTH waiting for the claims to be denied- and THEY COUNT ON THAT. They do have someone monitoring their social media who will respond to this and to them I say, ""your customer service is DREADFUL. If you are delaying claims FOR FOUR MONTHS (in my case) and they are going to ""review,"" YOUR CUSTOMER IS ENTITLED TO KNOW THAT. In a timely manner. And not by dragging it out of you.""

Initially I was drawn to the preventative package; no other company that I found offers that and typically the annual visit, vaccines and lab tests are the bulk of your vet costs for the year.

Last year however, our dog needed lots of diagnostics to understand her condition and ultimately surgery and rehab. Our girl was only 2 when her symptoms started and the though of giving her up due to financial constraints was truly heartbreaking.  I used the estimate tool to make sure everything would be covered and then booked the appts and submitted the invoices.  It was so easy!

Filed a claim for a wellness exam and instead of being reimbursed for it the money went towards my deductible. The employee I talked with was nice and tried to figure out why that happened but I still got no money back. I called to cancel and the employee I spoke with apparently never canceled my plan because I was charged for the next month.,1,Not worth it,3,,2021-07-13T21:33:16.000Z,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.pumpkin.care?page=50
